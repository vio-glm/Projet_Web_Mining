It's hard to believe one device can improve the appearance of wrinkles, support collagen production, reduce acne severity, and fight inflammation—but that's the beauty of LED light therapy masks . These at-home tools deliver serious results in just 10 minutes per day (trust me, I've tested my fair share of them). Right now, one of my personal favorite masks, the Solawave Wrinkle Retreat Light Therapy Mask , is on sale for $126 off. Solawave Wrinkle Retreat Light Therapy Face Mask $227 (was $349) What's great about the Solawave mask It's even better than my favorite Solawave products I've been a Solawave girlie for nearly two years now, and the brand's signature red light wand is one of my holy grail beauty products for a glowing complexion—but the wand has two drawbacks. The small light doesn't cover a lot of skin at once, and it only utilizes red light therapy. The original Solawave mask addressed my surface area concern, with red and blue light emitted from 66 LED bulbs. But the mask was missing an unsung hero: infrared light. This new and improved mask combines red (630nm) and near-infrared light (830nm), which have been shown to 1 increase the expression of collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid in the skin to promote a more even, plump, and youthful complexion. It's easy to use The mask is essentially hands-free. It has an attached handheld remote, but once you secure the mask on your face and click the power button, you're all set to go about your routine. Once the 10-minute treatment is complete, the mask automatically turns off. It's comfortable The silicone material is soft and flexible, with a Velcro strap that contours to your head for the perfect fit. Image by Carleigh Ferrante / mbg creative It's portable and lightweight I'm not the best at sticking with a skin care routine, especially when I travel. If a device isn't portable, it's not coming with me on any vacations (and I'll probably forget to start using it again). Thankfully, the Solawave mask is lightweight and easy to toss in any luggage or tote bag. It even comes with a soft carrying case! It's FDA-cleared I've interviewed a lot of dermatologists for their perspective on LED light devices, and there's one question they always have: ""Is it FDA-cleared?"" Solawave's Wrinkle Retreat Light Therapy Face Mask is medical grade and FDA-cleared, providing even more confidence in its efficacy and safety. The technology works Like I said, I'm often a skeptic when it comes to skin care brands that make big claims—but LED light therapy really does work. One study found that participants who used red light therapy on their face twice a week for 30 total sessions experienced improved skin complexion 2 , skin tone, skin smoothness, and collagen density. When testing red light face masks, I notice my skin immediately appears brighter and glowier, but it's the long-term perks that keep me coming back. With continued (and consistent!) use, I've experienced each of those aforementioned benefits—and my fine lines have smoothed significantly. Solawave Wrinkle Retreat Light Therapy Face Mask $227 (was $349) The takeaway Ever since introducing red and infrared light therapy into my routine, my skin feels (and looks!) like it's aging backward. And if these science-backed benefits aren't enough, take it from the thousands of skin care fanatics who flock to Solawave for every new product launch. The new Wrinkle Retreat Light Therapy Face Mask is already almost out of stock again—so don't miss your chance to get it for $126 off. 2 Sources https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(19)33160-3/abstract#:~:text=PDF%20%5B132%20KB%5D-,Low%2Dlevel%20red%20and%20infrared%20light%20increases%20expression%20of%20collagen,and%20hyaluronic%20acid%20in%20skin&amp;text=Light%20therapy%20has%20attracted%20medical,for%20photoaging%20and%20photodamaged%20skin. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926176/"
https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/read-this-if-you-dont-want-kids,"It's OK To Not Want Kids: Here Are 3 Convincing Reasons Why | mindbodygreen Skip to Content Accessibility Statement Parenting | expert reviewed 3 Reasons Why It's Totally OK To Not Want Kids Author: Amanda Shayne Expert reviewer: Kristina Hallett, Ph.D., ABPP April 29, 2020 By Amanda Shayne mbg Contributor Amanda Shayne is a certified life coach, dedicated to helping women navigate the world of family planning. Expert review by Kristina Hallett, Ph.D., ABPP Board-certified Clinical Psychologist Kristina Hallett, Ph.D., ABPP is a board-certified clinical psychologist with a background in neuroscience. She is also the Director of Clinical Training at Bay Path University, and an associate professor in Graduate Psychology. April 29, 2020 It's OK to not want kids. It's OK if you don't want to be a parent, and there's nothing wrong with you if that's the case. It's also OK to not know yet whether you want to have kids. One thing's for sure though: Feeling pressured and obsessing over what everyone else wants isn't going to help you make your decision. The truth is, you can be happy no matter what you choose. Although every person's journey is very personal, here are three reasons why it’s OK not to want to have kids. 1. You decide what stories to tell. For years I thought that deciding not to have kids would mean a bunch of awful things about myself. I told myself that I should want to have kids, and if I didn’t have them, then I’d be less of a woman. I’d be missing out. I wouldn’t fit in. And all of that would mean something was wrong with me. Now I see that it was all a story I was telling myself. A completely optional story. It’s all subjective. Case in point: I’ve coached women who believed stories similar to the ones I used to tell myself, and yet there are plenty of women who told themselves very different stories about their motherhood decision, as illustrated in Meghan Daum’s anthology Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids . At the end of the day, we can find evidence to support any story we tell. So why not look for evidence to support beautiful stories about our lives? Stories that help us become the best versions of ourselves? Because as research professor Dr. Brené Brown says, ""The most dangerous stories we make up are the narratives that diminish our inherent worthiness."" So let’s say you decide not to have kids. What will you make that mean? And does that make you feel like crap? Regardless of what you choose, you’re the one who decides what stories you tell yourself. Choosing not to have kids doesn’t have to mean anything horrible. In fact, it doesn’t have to mean anything at all. It can just be. 2. The people who want you to have kids will be OK. When’s the last time you tried to make someone happy? We’re a funny bunch, we humans, thinking we can control other people’s feelings. Because even though it’s common to want to make people happy, the reality is we can’t make someone feel a certain way. Sure, we can do what they want us to do and maybe make it easier for them to feel happy, but any happiness they then feel is because of their own thoughts and their own stories. Many of you know this firsthand: Even when you do something to make someone else happy, chances are it works for a moment and then they revert back to the same old problems that bothered them in the first place. So if there’s a person who desperately wants you to have a baby, know that they’ll be OK should you decide not to become a mother. Your not having kids could never make them feel bad—just like your having kids could never make them feel good. Any emotions they feel will be created by their own thoughts, and that’s their own responsibility. I recommend doing your best to feel good about how you communicate your decision and letting go of the rest. 3. You can survive any emotion. Let’s say you decide not to have kids, yet you hang on to the story that not wanting kids means something’s wrong with you. You’re probably going to feel pretty crappy about your decision, right? But the great news is you can survive shame. You can survive sadness. You can survive regret and fear and any other emotion. And not only that, but you can learn to process any emotion in an efficient way—a way that promotes healing and limits the pain you continue to cause yourself. Here’s the best way I know to process any emotion: Acknowledge whatever you’re feeling. It might help to literally say to yourself, This is guilt. This is shame. This is sadness. Let it be there. Don’t judge yourself for feeling it—you’re human. Observe the emotion. What does it actually feel like in your body? Is it a heaviness in your stomach? A warmth in your chest? If you can take the time to describe it in detail, you’ll realize that the worst part of a crappy emotion is resisting it. When it’s just pure guilt or pure shame or whatever, without the resistance, it’s really not so unpleasant. Pay attention to the thoughts that caused this specific emotion. What’s going on in your head? Own your part in this experience. When you can see the connection between your thoughts and the feelings they create for you, you realize your own power in managing your emotions. It's all good. Really. So, as you sit in your indecision, know that everything is OK. When you’re ready, you can land on your feet with confidence, love, and some serious self-compassion—regardless of what you choose. Even if you're experiencing frustrating indecision right now, know that this experience is still important. This is you realizing your own power in creating the life you want—one you love deeply."

In feng shui , these zones have the biggest impact on the overall energy and feel of your space. Clean and declutter them first, before moving on to the rest of the home: 1 . The front door A home attracts its energy, or chi, through the front door. That's why this area is probably the most important spot to get right in feng shui. The more clean, vibrant, and welcoming the front door, the better the quality of the chi for residents. I decided to paint mine a bright orange color in order to attract vibrant energy (bonus, this color never looks dirty or aged), but you can decorate your door according to the element that corresponds to the gua it's in. (Here's an introduction to bagua maps if they're new to you, and this resource will show you which gua your front door is located in.) Lighting should be bright enough so that your porch or front door stand out. Make sure your house number is very visible from the street or, if you live in an apartment, visible from the hallway. Treat ""chi"" like a guest who is searching their way to your home. 2 . The entryway A decluttered front entrance is important, too. In feng shui, we call the entryway and the front door ""the mouth of chi."" Similar to how we take in breath through our nostrils and airways, we receive life force energy through the mouth of Chi—so it's essential to keep that area clean! There's an old Chinese tradition to sweep your entryway daily with a broom. These days, using your favorite vacuum works too. Even if your front door opens straight into the living area and you don't have a designated entryway, I'd still recommend creating a space that retains the energy of the door and prevents it from entering your home too fast. A low bookshelf, an area rug, or a round console table with flowers on it can help establish this area. The entryway gives a taste for the rest of the house, so make sure it flows well and gives guests a sense of where they are expected to go. 3 . The stove In feng shui, the kitchen can be compared to the heart of the home, as it's where a home's warmth comes from. A kitchen should not feel cold or have a ""cutting"" energy. It should be cozy and inviting. Within the kitchen, the stove is an appliance that requires daily attention. Since it's a symbol of prosperity, it needs to be spotless. So if you're using your stove daily (which is also recommended in feng shui since cooking and sharing meals with family and friends attracts abundance), it's important to clean it after use —even if it's just a quick wipe down. 4 . Windows and mirrors Your home's mirrors and windows represent clarity of mind and prosperity, so they should be kept clean and clear too. Wipe them down every couple of days or at least every week if you have kids and/or pets, or live in a dusty or rainy area. I know it can be a pain, but the satisfaction that comes with cleaning a window or mirror is just sublime. In my experience, doing so provides the brain with a quick burst of dopamine. It's basically a healthier version of getting likes on Instagram. 5 . The center of the home Finally, the condition of the center of the home affects whether or not your chi gets harmoniously distributed through the rest of the space. Vacuum and tidy up this area daily. No clutter is allowed in the center, as it gets in the way of chi and keeps it from providing harmonious energy to the different guas ."

Potential solutions Expert intel The takeaway Image by Santi Nuñez / Stocksy March 07, 2024 Ultra-processed foods are as addictive as certain drugs—and it's time to call out the dangers they pose to public health. That's the strong stance that scientists and physicians took in an in-depth analysis recently published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) 1 . In light of this report, we were curious to dig into what, exactly, makes it so hard to stop eating the processed foods that inundate the inner aisles of grocery stores worldwide. So, we recruited an internal medicine physician and nutritionist to help us unpack this new analysis, its significance, and what it could mean for the future of food. Meet the experts: Anant Vinjamoori, M.D. : Harvard-trained, board-certified internal medicine physician and chief medical officer at Modern Age. Vinjamoori's clinical focus is longevity and healthy aging. He prioritizes a multi-system, preventive approach to well-being. Jessica Shapiro, M.S., R.D., CDN, CDCES : certified diabetes educator, registered dietitian, and associate wellness and nutrition manager at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. Shapiro believes in both holistic and realistic improvements when it comes to nutrition to support a sustainable healthy lifestyle. What are ultra-processed foods? Plenty of foods are processed before consumption—they can be frozen, roasted, spiced, and more. So, what exactly does ""ultra-processed food"" mean? ""Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) can be loaded with ingredients, many of which are sugar, salt, fat, and other substances derived or extracted from real food (think 'made in the lab') and/or additives such as artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives,"" Shapiro explains. Vinjamoori adds that ultra-processed foods lack the essential nutrients we need to maintain optimal health (i.e., protein , fiber , etc.). This is why consuming more UPFs than whole or minimally processed foods can pose an overall health risk. ""Ultra-processed foods are also nutrient-poor, meaning they lack essential vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial compounds, and consistently consuming these foods can lead to nutritional deficiencies and inflammation, which can shorten one's life span and lead to obesity and a variety of diseases,"" Vinjamoori states. This level of processing is often used to boost sales of the product and preserve its shelf life, as well as bring down the cost of production. According to the BMJ analysis, addiction to these foods has become just as prevalent as addiction to other legal substances like alcohol and tobacco. ""A recent analysis of two systematic reviews including 281 studies from 36 different countries found the overall pooled prevalence of food addiction using [the Yale Food Addiction Scale] was 14% in adults and 12% in children,"" the authors state. This prevalence is quite similar to the levels of addiction seen for other legal substances in adults (noting 14% for alcohol and 18% for tobacco), but the level of implied addiction in children is unprecedented, they say. In the full analysis 1 , the authors dive deep into the health and longevity implications of this addiction, including higher rates of chronic diseases, mental health and cognition concerns, and worse treatment outcomes. What makes them so addictive? Ultra-processed foods aren't addictive just because they taste good: Their structure actually impacts the brain's reward centers. The high carbohydrate and fat content in many UPFs has a direct impact on the brain's dopamine pathways 2 , which play a role in reward and motivation. The BMJ analysis even noted that the spike in dopamine is so high that it's comparable to the rise seen with addictive substances such as nicotine and alcohol. This isn't a mere analogy; it's an acknowledgment of the real, tangible impact these foods can have on our neurobiology. In addition, UPFs can deliver carbs and fat to the brain very quickly, further contributing to their addictive potential. The faster a substance can reach the brain, the more addictive it can be. ""This is the rationale behind substitution therapies and why a cigarette, which rapidly delivers nicotine to the brain, is more addictive than a slow-release nicotine transdermal patch,"" the analysis authors explain. ""This isn't a mere analogy; it's an acknowledgment of the real, tangible impact these foods can have on our neurobiology,"" Vinjamoori says. He notes that we have more than enough compelling evidence on the health risks of ultra-processed foods to warrant major change. A new update A systematic review of meta-analysis studies published in the British Medical Journal in February 2024 found direct associations between exposure to ultra-processed foods and 32 different harmful health effects . This included cardiovascular, cancer, gastrointestinal, mental, metabolic, and mortality-related concerns. “These findings provide a rationale to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of using population based and public health measures to target and reduce dietary exposure to ultra-processed foods for improved human health,” the study authors note. What scientists propose As for what we can do to reduce the risk of addiction to ultra-processed foods, the analysis includes four tangible recommendations: Taxes on ultra-processed food (UPF) and beverage: For this suggestion, researchers lean on the evidence from previous food-related taxes including the sugar-sweetened beverage tax (SSB) that 103 countries 3 have adopted thus far. Preliminary evidence has also linked such taxes with reductions in body mass index among adolescent girls in Mexico 4 and declines in dental caries among people with low incomes in a large U.S. city 5 , the BMJ report states, implying that a tax on UPFs could help to reduce consumption and thus reduce the health-related concerns UPFs have on the body. Labels on ultra-processed foods: Food producers in over 20 countries, including Argentina , are now required to add labels to some ultra-processed foods high in sodium, sugar, fat, and calories. Researchers note that labeling schemes like these could make it easier for consumers to make healthy choices in the store. Mandatory or voluntary reformulation of the food supply: A few programs have encouraged food companies to make their offerings less salty or fatty—and they have led to promising early results. The UK's voluntary salt reduction plan , for example, led to a 15% reduction in sodium intake 6 and 42% and 40% reduction in stroke and ischaemic heart disease mortality over eight years. New York City's trans-fat ban in restaurants has been associated with 4.5% drop in cardiovascular disease mortality 7 since 2008. ""In addition, the implementation of healthier nutrition standards in U.S. schools was associated with reductions in body mass index among youth 8 ,"" the authors note. This is strong evidence that changes in the food supply can have a positive trickle-down effect on public health. A suite of policies targeting UPFs: Finally, the authors point out the need for a multipronged approach to ultra-processed food policy. ""No one food policy will transform unhealthy food environments. Countries such as Chile and Mexico have implemented a bundle of healthy food policies, including taxes, nutrition labels, and marketing regulations on UPFs,"" they note. This bundle approach has led to a significant decrease 9 in highly processed food and beverage sales in some countries. What experts think about the new proposition As the popular saying goes, actions speak louder than words—and this analysis can only be considered a success if it inspires action. That said, many positive changes could come from this recommendation if put into motion. ""If 'food addiction' becomes an official diagnosis, then there would likely be more opportunities for research around the topic,"" Shapiro says, adding, ""This could also improve insurance coverage and more access to professional support for those looking for help."" On the flip side, she says that there is a stigma attached to being 'addicted' to a substance, even if it is food, so the way we discuss addiction as a society would also have to change. ""As we continue to uncover the mechanisms linking ultra-processed foods to potential addictive behaviors, there's a clear societal responsibility at hand,"" Vinjamoori adds. ""Not only do we need to transparently communicate these findings to the general public, but we also must advocate for protective policies. Moreover, it's imperative that we develop clinical resources and tools specifically designed to address food addiction."" Finally, there is another significant hurdle to cross before less processed diets can go mainstream: economic and geographical inequities in the food system. Framing UPFs as addictive may be a step in the right direction to encourage systemic change in the food industry and apply pressure for health care and health insurance to take nutrition more seriously—which is great. However, until natural and minimally processed foods become more affordable and accessible than ultra-processed foods, there will always be a layer of inequality rooted in food access and nutrition choices . The takeaway Nutrition scientists recently published a data analysis in the British Medical Journal with a suggestion to call out the addictive nature of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and advocate for change in the food industry, encouraging government regulation and public education. The data shows that UPFs affect the brain's dopamine receptors in a similar way (and to a similar degree) as addictive substances like nicotine and alcohol, in part due to their carbohydrate-to-fat ratio. These foods also lack the nutrients the human body needs to function properly, which is another reason experts are concerned about the mass consumption of UPFs in America. The path to limiting the negative public health impacts of UPFs is long, complex, and multifaceted, but hopefully, this BMJ analysis will serve as a jumping-off point for increased awareness and action. Throughout this process, it will be essential for those advocating for change to acknowledge the economic disparities of food. The recommendations provided in the analysis give us a glimpse into a world where access to whole, nutrient-dense food is a human right—and that's definitely something worth working toward. 9 Sources https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj-2023-075354 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124340/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36988952/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902003/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36863896/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24732242/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26620830/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36780186/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7012389/"
https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/5-tips-to-create-an-evening-routine-for-great-sleep,"5 Tips To Create An Evening Routine For Great Sleep | mindbodygreen Skip to Content Accessibility Statement Integrative Health 5 Tips To Create An Evening Routine For Great Sleep Author: Paula Watkins, PhD June 01, 2015 Clinical Psychologist By Paula Watkins, PhD Clinical Psychologist Paula Watkins, PhD, is a clinical psychologist, meditation expert, and also holds a PhD in Public Health and Community Medicine. Photo by Getty Images June 01, 2015 The quality of your sleep has an enormous impact on well-being (both physically and psychologically), and is partly affected by your bedtime routine. Most people recognize the need for bedtime routines in children, but so often forget to honor the need for these routines as adults. Yet poor sleep affects us in the just the same way as it affects children: we feel irritable, stressed and can have difficulty concentrating during the day. The overall result is low mood and lowered productivity. A good bedtime routine can result in significant reductions in problematic sleep. Here are five tips for creating a mindful sleep routine: 1. Make ""power down"" time a priority. Shut down those activities that stimulate your mind, such as work, emails, internet browsing and even watching TV. The general guideline is to try to avoid backlit devices at night (such as screens) because these are stimulating to the eyes and brain, sending the message that it's daytime and therefore awake time. Try reading a book, taking a bath , listening to music or practicing some gentle yoga or meditation. Develop rituals that work for you. 2. Try a brain dump if your mind is running on overdrive. Dump it all out. Write some lists, or simply use the ""worry diary"" technique and jot down all of the things you’re stressing about. Try not to do this right before bed, but rather before your ""power down"" time. This helps your mind let these things go. Once they're written down, you can relax ; there's no chance you'll forget them. 3. Eat, drink and move mindfully. Caffeine isn’t ""bad,"" but it is a stimulant and should be used mindfully. If you’re experiencing sleeping problems, cutting back on caffeine (particularly after midday) is generally a good idea. It’s also a good idea to avoid eating a particularly heavy meal late in the evening — you want to go to bed satiated but not overly full. Some meditations and supplements can also affect sleep so it’s best to get educated about what you’re taking. Remember that exercise is one of your best friends when it comes to managing overall stress levels. However, intense exercise late at night isn't recommended for anyone experiencing sleeping problems. Experiment with your training routine and discover what works best for you. Perhaps your high-intensity training is best in the morning, leaving the evenings for yoga. 4. Create the right environment for sleep. This generally means ensuring your bedroom is sufficiently dark enough, quiet enough and well ventilated to allow for good sleep. Take the time to study what works best for you in terms of temperature, light and noise. Less obviously, you might discover that your stress levels increase according to how much mess is in your personal space. These tricks work because they provide the foundation for a relaxed body, which is a precondition for a relaxed mind. 5. Monitor your sleep, and keep a sleep schedule. Aim to go to bed and wake up at the same times every day. If you’re experiencing sleeping difficulties it’s also a good idea to keep a record of exactly when you do get to bed, how often (and for how long) you wake during the night and what time you get up. This information will be helpful for your clinician if you decide to visit your GP or a psychologist for help with sleeping."

If you've ever gone through the experience of looking for romantic partners on a dating app, you've probably encountered profiles that just screamed catfish—aka a fake profile, robot, or other type of scam. But research suggests some personality types are more likely than others to fall for a catfish. Catfishing, aka online romantic fraud, is still alive and well these days. According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission , online romance scams reported to the FBI tripled between 2012 and 2016, and the Better Business Bureau reports that Americans have reported losses of nearly $1 billion due to romance scams. One company that screens profiles for dating companies told the BBB that 500,000 of the 3.5 million profiles it scans every month are fake. People at risk of getting catfished In a review published last month in the Clinical Practice & Epidemiology in Mental Health journal, researchers culled the scientific literature to identify common trends in the types of people who tend to fall for catfishes. They found and analyzed 12 relevant studies. From these, they found that 63% of social media users report having been a victim of catfishing at least once. These were the personality types most likely to fall for a catfish: Romantics (aka people who tend to idealize romantic relationships and romance in general) People high in neuroticism (aka anxious people or those who deal with a lot of negative feelings in general) Sensation-seeking people Impulsive people People with addictive personalities People with codependent tendencies Women and middle-aged people were also generally more likely to fall for catfishes than people of other genders and ages. What to do about it The personality traits listed above all have something in common: They're vulnerable to getting swept up in an exciting new romance easily. ""The scammer always acts empathetically and attempts to create the impression in the victim that the two are perfectly synced in their shared view of life,"" the researchers write in the paper on their findings. ""The declarations of the scammer become increasingly affectionate and...a declaration of love is made within two weeks from initial contact."" So if you fall into any of the above categories, it doesn't hurt to make sure you take budding relationships slowly—and not just to avoid getting catfished! Rushing into relationships too quickly can generally be a recipe for disaster, exposing you to the risk of becoming emotionally dependent , getting attached to emotionally unavailable people, and other common relationship troubles. In her book Love Skills , marriage therapist Linda Carroll, LMFT , recommends all people in the earlier honeymoon stage of their relationship avoid trusting only their heart . ""Beware of the fantasy of permanent bliss that this stage wraps you up in,"" she writes. ""That spectacular spike in feel-good neurochemicals can overpower common sense. … Take time to step back and observe your emotions and behaviors; ask yourself whether they're objectively rational. Ask a trusted friend for a candid opinion about your relationship. Awareness is key."" Oh, and definitely don't send money to a person you met online that you've never met in person before. Good rule of thumb!"

Following a tough workout, for example, some inflammation is to be expected and is a sign that your muscles are reacting to the stimulus appropriately. ""To repair damaged muscles, your body responds with acute inflammation to absorb the damaged cells and get rid of them. This breakdown and repair process is how you gradually get stronger, fitter, and grow muscle,"" holistic nutritionist and athlete Melissa Boufounos, CHN , previously explained on mindbodygreen . While you don't need to feel sore to know you had a good workout, a little tenderness is nothing to avoid. However, research shows that in some cases, workouts can contribute to chronically high levels of inflammatory markers 1 that increase your risk of injury and may even prompt catabolism 2 , or the breakdown of muscle tissue. Here's how to avoid chronic inflammation following exercise—and how a supplement might help. How to reduce inflammation after tough exercise The best way to combat chronic inflammation and maintain a healthy inflammatory response is to give your body adequate time to recover from exercise. This means spacing out your tougher workouts , prioritizing high-quality sleep , and rehydrating quickly . Your nutrition makes a big difference too. An "" anti-inflammatory diet "" usually consists of plenty of protein (30+ grams a meal), fiber, and healthy fats and is low in processed foods, refined sugars, and trans fats. Certain supplements have also been shown to decrease markers of inflammation following exercise, including creatine . Creatine's anti-inflammatory effects for recovery creatine with magnesium+ Strong. Focused. Renewed. A review published in the journal Nutrients found evidence that creatine supplementation has anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic effects 3 . Creatine plays a critical role in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body's primary energy source. Our bodies naturally produce creatine, but supplemental creatine is also widely available and relatively affordable. ""The number of studies examining the anti-inflammatory effects of creatine supplementation in various disease and exercise states continues to grow with promising results,"" the Nutrients review reads. For example, one randomized controlled trial found that supplementing with creatine during half-ironman training was associated with lower inflammatory markers post-race 4 . And it's not just extreme endurance athletes who could benefit from adding creatine to their recovery routine. Beyond preventing muscle breakdown (catabolism), creatine also seems to increase measures of muscle mass and performance in adults 5 of all ages 6 and fitness levels when combined with resistance exercise. Research shows that adding creatine to your training routine can increase muscular strength in as little as two weeks 7 , as well as support a greater reduction in body fat percentage 8 than resistance training alone. Moral of the story: If you're bumping up your time in the gym, creatine may help reduce the negative wear-and-tear of training and increase its positive effects. The supplement is considered very safe in the fitness community , and taking 3-5 grams per day seems to be a sweet spot for everyday athletes looking for performance and recovery benefits.

Image by Rawpixel / iStock January 12, 2023 Our series Healthy Planet, Healthy You explores just how tightly human health and environmental health are intertwined—for better and for worse. Each month, we'll share the latest news on how nature can rejuvenate us on one hand and damage our health when it's not cared for on the other. We'll end with timely tips and tools to help you care for your environment so it can care for you. 1 . We talk a lot about the microplastics in the ocean—but what about the ones in the air? According to a new study out of Auckland, New Zealand, airborne microplastics are more prevalent than we previously thought (or would care to believe). By using an extra-perceptive sensor that could pick up tiny plastic particles as small as 0.01 of a millimeter, researchers found that 74 metric tons of microplastics are dropping out of the atmosphere onto the city annually—roughly the same as 3 million plastic bottles . ""The smaller the size ranges we looked at, the more microplastics we saw. This is notable because the smallest sizes are the most toxicologically relevant,"" lead study author Joel Rindelaub, Ph.D., said in a news release . Scientists are now investigating the toll that breathing in so many plastic particles daily might play on our health over time. ( Read the research here 1 .) 2 . As the human population grows, nature experiences are harder to come by. How has human interaction with nature changed over the last few decades? That's the question that fueled an ambitious new research project studying how close people live to nature now, compared to 20 years ago. Researchers defined a natural area as one with a low ""human footprint"" (buildings, roads, etc.). They found that the average person currently lives 9.7 kilometers (6 miles) away from a natural area, which is 7% farther away than we did in the year 2000. ""Indeed, the study reveals that the destruction of natural areas combined with a strong increase in urban population is leading to a growing spatial distance between humans and nature, especially in Asia, Africa and South America,"" Gladys Barragan-Jason, Ph.D., a co-author of the study, says in a news release . Barragan-Jason's team found that we might be becoming more emotionally distanced too, as there is proportionally less nature imagery in novels, songs, children's albums, and animated movies these days than there was several decades ago. ( Read the research here .) 3 . Plankton holds a key to ocean health—and potentially human health too. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, are now studying a century-old survey of marine plankton to see how it can serve as a time capsule for ocean health. Since these tiny organisms are very sensitive to changes in their environment, they can show how aquatic conditions have been polluted over time. Scientists now wonder if changes in plankton can also show us how human health has declined alongside marine health and if there are any parallels between plankton decline and the increasing rate of chronic illness in humans. ( Read the research here 2 .) 4 . Climate change will make plants more productive—but that isn't necessarily a good thing. Since carbon is used in photosynthesis, increasing CO 2 levels in the atmosphere can help plants grow faster and be more productive 3 . Sounds like a good thing for crops and the food system, right? Not exactly, scientists say. Take this new study out of Michigan State University that found that though carbon dioxide increases photosynthesis, it does so at the expense of other essential metabolic processes in plants. ""Plants like CO 2 . If you give them more of it, they'll make more food and they'll grow bigger. But what if you get a bigger plant that has a lower protein content? It'll actually be less nutritious,"" Berkley Walker, Ph.D., whose research team authored the report, says in a news release . ( Read the research here 4 .) Monthly focus: Climate conversations. Reading about climate change can bring up a wide range of heavy emotions . It's a lot to sit with by yourself. Talking about these issues with others is a healthy way to vent your concerns, support each other, and maybe even come up with some solutions together. Looking to build out your climate community in the new year? Why not start an eco book club? I can say from personal experience (hey, club!) that sharing climate fears and anxieties with other people is extremely cathartic. Book clubs can also be wonderful spaces to share knowledge and resources and discuss how to take inspired action. It doesn't need to be a huge undertaking: Just gathering a few friends to discuss a great climate-focused book every few months can lead to insights. When you're ready to get started, these titles are ready for you . 4 Sources https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36459143/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722083267?via%3Dihub https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00578/full https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-022-01294-9"

Image by mbg creative X Daphne Miller June 30, 2021 It's no secret that home gardens have exploded in popularity of late —whether you opt for mood-lifting flowers or are partial to edible plant plots. When it comes to the latter, family physician and science journalist Daphne Miller, M.D., welcomes the move toward homegrown harvest: ""I'm seeing this expansion of the terrace, front yard, backyard, side yard, and sidewalk farming movement,"" she says on this episode of the mindbodygreen podcast (indoor windowsill gardens, too!). ""I see that as a really amazing source of both nutrients and beautification in the neighborhood."" But if you are going to start your own edible home garden, you may wonder: Which healthy plants are the most beginner-friendly ? Below, Miller lists a few underrated superstars that are surprisingly easy to nurture. Consider them low-maintenance crops that pack quite a nutritious punch: 1 . Herbs & spices No surprise, Miller is a fan of the humble herb garden: ""The oreganos, the thymes, the rosemaries, the alliums—all of these things that give you a lot of nutrition bang for your buck,"" she says. Let's dip into the research: Studies have shown that the flavonoids and phenolic acid in oregano can help manage inflammation and oxidative stress 1 ; thyme has well-documented immune-supporting powers 2 ; rosemary touts antioxidant and neuroprotective properties 3 ; finally, alliums (think garlic, scallion, shallot, leek, and chives) are chock-full of antioxidant properties—some experts even recommend eating a clove of garlic a day , if you can tolerate the taste. In terms of ease, herbs are notoriously low-maintenance: ""Herbs tend to recede themselves,"" says Miller, and they tend to be perennial (meaning, they live on for multiple growing seasons). See here for how to prep your very own herb garden . 2 . Chayote This Mexican squash is rich in antioxidants, fiber, and phytonutrients—namely, quercetin and myricetin 4 (another powerful flavonoid). One study even found that dried chayote had an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect in older adults with metabolic syndrome 5 . The gourd has a flavor akin to a cucumber or jicama, and you can enjoy it cooked or raw—simply snap it right off the vine. 3 . Kale Miller also touts the ease of kale trees. For those without a yard, don't worry—these trees typically grow 2 to 3 feet tall, and they're pretty resilient: ""[They] can really take everything from tons of water to a minimum of water,"" says Miller. She continues, ""These perennial trees produce the most delicious, buttery, sweet kale leaves."" In case you need a refresher on the health benefits of kale , the cruciferous veggie is high in vitamins, antioxidants, and fiber. Often dubbed a ""nutritional powerhouse,"" this is one worthy plant for your home garden. 4 . Nopales Of course, we'd be remiss not to mention cactus, as these ""really take no water,"" says Miller—perfect for the forgetful plant parents among us. Nopales refer to the pads of the cactus, and, according to Miller, are low-glycemic players with tons of antioxidant capabilities; one study even found that the nopal cactus may have neuroprotective properties 6 . ""You can just cut off one pad and actually eat it raw,"" Miller notes. ""There's a great way to prepare it raw and make a salad with it. [It's] delicious with lime or lemon."" Sounds delightfully thirst-quenching, no? The takeaway. ""These are all vegetables that do very well within local soil and give right back in terms of nutrition,"" says Miller. In other words: They don't take much to grow, yet they pack in health benefits. Seems like a sound investment to us. Enjoy this episode sponsored by Cotton !
