https://thestripe.com/great-books-to-read-on-a-beach-vacation/,the stripe my favorite thing about a vacation specifically a beach vacation is all of the reading time there is nothing better than the feeling of having nothing to do nowhere to be no real responsibilities just sitting in the sunshine and losing yourself in a great book preferably with a tropical drink in hand it is the perfect escape from reality and something i so enjoy i ll be on cape cod with my family in a couple weeks and plan my books like i plan my outfits this list is lighter on thrillers i tend to prefer happier books on vacation and read a mix of lighter reads historical fiction young adult etc all of these books are page turners for sure but none of them except maybe the chateau are scary this is a mix of favorite books to read from over the years i wanted to include a mix of old and new as i tend to focus on new releases for my monthly lists but i know i have a lot of library readers so placing holds is easier with older books so here we are some new some old all of them perfect for a beach vacation ps this post is from two summers ago but i wanted to freshened it up last year and then again this year great books to read on a beach vacation these are in no particular order just a list of favorites from over the years that i think would be the absolutely perfect books to read at the beach or on vacation consider this my summer reading master list from fast paced page turners to sweet love stories i ve got you the seven husbands of evelyn hugo by taylor jenkins reid this is one of my all time favorite books i think it would be such a fantastic summer read if you have not already read it it is glamorous and glitzy with plenty of heartache happiness too in between i found it unputdownable and though i read it long ago and passed it onto a friend i forget who it has stuck with me and i often think about buying another copy just to have and re read again it is an absolute favorite and such an escape if you have not read this book yet it is from i implore you it is an absolute must read order on amazon or bookshop org people we meet on vacation by emily henry i loved this book i am not a big romance person but could not get enough of this book and these characters when i was doing the podcast we even had emily henry on to talk about it she is for the record a total gem of a human i would love to be friends with her irl which of course makes me want to read all of her books this is a fun love story with deeply likable and relatable characters i read this while in palm springs my first post lockdown vacation last year where a total coincidence i didn t know going into it the book was set now i want to try to match my books to my vacation it was fun reading a place while actually being there order on amazon or bookshop org malibu rising by taylor jenkins reid we love taylor jenkins reid i think she may be the only author i give repeats to on this list she is probably my favorite for lighter beach reads as her novels are so transportive usually from an error and usually involving wealthy and glamorous celebrities of some sort this one set in malibu is about a family of favorite siblings who have dealt with more than their fair share of hard times too in the eighties there is nina the talented surfer super model her brothers jay and hud one is a champion surfer the other a photographer and their little sister kit there is drama and glamour galore all the fixings for a perfect beach read order on amazon or bookshop org in a new york minute by kate spencer this was another one of those romance novels that had me thinking hmm maybe i do like romance after all but it is so much more than a romance novel it is in my eyes a love story to new york especially being young in new york city which i was long ago if you have moved out of new york and find yourself missing it this is the book for you i loved every minute of this it is the perfect escape to new york it starts with one of those bad days that we have all had you are laid off from your job sweating on the subway your dress rips with a believable and relatable yet swoon worthy meet cute and then turns into a hilarious embarrassing story and ultimately yes a love story i adored this it didn t hurt that it is written by kate spencer co host of forever one of my favorite podcasts order on amazon or bookshop org cover story by susan rigetti i was having scammer fatigue blame it on all the scammer related tv inventing anna wecrashed the dropout so wasn t sure what i would think of this but i absolutely loved it this is such a fun book it s anna delvey mixed with a little bit of caroline calloway i said this in last month s reading list but i think that this book is going to be s prime beach read lora ricci is a naive college student struggling to make ends meet attending nyu and interning for elle when she meets glamorous clean energy heiress cat wolff the two form a highly unlikely friendship with lora ultimately dropping out of nyu moving in with cat at the plaza hotel and going to work as her ghostwriter chaos ensues you feel so much secondhand anxiety for lora i really do think that this is going to be one of the most popular summer reads this year order on amazon or bookshop org sister stardust by jane green a little bit of historical fiction but the fun kind it felt a little bit like a mashup of the seven husbands of evelyn hugo and daisy jones and the six think of an older wiser woman telling her story of her younger wilder irresponsible years in sixties london and morocco claire is from a small town outside of london she has a difficult relationship with her stepmother she struggles with her weight she has no idea what she s doing with her life a chance encounter leads her to morocco and suddenly she s befriended a group of incredible musicians fashion designers and artists she befriends the magnetic ethereal talitha getty falling a bit in love with her in the process but the glittery life is not as it seems order on amazon or bookshop org she regrets nothing by andrea dunlop this book is a fun trainwreck in the best way possible when layla lawrence is orphaned at just years old her cousins show up at her funeral the only thing is she didn t even know she had cousins there s liberty who is years older plus the twins leo and nora living a glamorous life in new york city turns out laila is from an incredibly wealthy manhattan family but laila s father had become estranged from his parents and moved to the midwest before laila was born laila up and moves to new york living with her cousin nora but all that glitters is not gold she makes every possible mistake recklessly social climbs and relentlessly pursues the lifestyle she feels she was so unfairly denied again a trainwreck in the best way possible i could not put it down order on amazon or bookshop org the chrystie affair by nina de gramont another fun and very imaginative historical fiction read i really enjoyed it much more than i thought i would if i am being honest it ended up being quite the page turner for me in case you weren t familiar with the backstory agatha christie disappeared for twelve days back in just after her husband had requested a divorce upon being found in a hotel she simply stated that she didn t remember what happened this is an imaginative fictional look at what could have happened during those twelve days it is clever and smart and told interestingly enough from the perspective of her husband archie s mistress nan o dea the clincher is that nan does not seem to love archie so why destroy his marriage order on bookshop org or amazon the blue bistro by elin hilderbrand this is my favorite elin hilderbrand book and we all know that elin hilderbrand is the queen of the beach read i really love that it is set in a restaurant having grown up in a restaurant and literally worked every single job possible i will read anything set in a restaurant adrienne dealey has spent her professional career bouncing around luxe destinations working in hotels after a particularly bad breakup her ex took all her money she heads to nantucket for the summer with one objective make money she manages to snag a job as the assistant manager at nantucket s fanciest restaurant during the restaurant s last summer she falls hard for the boss owner thatcher smith but what the heck is going on between his co owner fiona honestly in reading it i would have thought elin had spent much of her life working in restaurants her research and attention to detail was that good this is my ideal summer read order it on amazon or bookshop org the idea of you by robinne lee i had to include this on the off chance that any of you have not read this book as it was a massive bad on paper podcast we did it as a book club pick in the early days and had robinne on as well something tells me that is highly unlikely but oh my if you have not read it drop what you are doing and fix that immediately it took me a little while to come around on this the idea of a year old falling in love with a year old felt gross to me but my friend becca wore me down the plot is very fun and steamy and somehow believable despite the he writing and descriptions of solene s outfits is all so good that i just gobbled it up a very chic divorced french mother takes her teen daughter to a thinly veiled harry styles concert somehow they find themselves in love highly recommend also did you see it is going to be made into a movie starring anne hathaway order on amazon or bookshop org olga dies dreaming by xochitl gonzalez i actually listened to this one as an audiobook it was wonderful and felt more like a performance than a reading and cannot tell you how much i enjoyed it it tackles so many important issues aids sexuality puerto rican culture and history but is packaged as a lighthearted fun book about a wedding planner her many suitors and her closeted politician brother and it is at times light and fun while also being serious both and i really loved it this is a very complicated family story brother and sister olga and prieto both doing great things in new york prieto is a congressman and olga is one of new york city s top wedding planners were abandoned by their mother a radical anarchist they struggle to balance their social ambitions with the sadness over their absent mother all in the wake of hurricane maria order on amazon or bookshop org the knockoff by lucy sykes jo piazza this is another classic beach read in my opinion and will always be an absolute favorite of mine especially as i spent such a long time working for a fashion start up there were definitely some funny parallels and of course because i always wanted to work for a magazine when i was young imogen returns to work at glossy a fashion mag after taking months off for health reasons and finds everything has changed eve her former assistant straight out of harvard business school has been put in charge and is hell bent on digitalizing the magazine something that s necessary for the magazine to survive but she s doing it all wrong and without any sensitivity the authors do a great job capturing the difference between the old guard of print media and the young new generation of digital media does imogen pack it up and get out of there or adapt and learn how to tweet i couldn t put it down i absolutely loved it it s fresh funny and smart if you work in fashion or digital media it s an absolute must order on amazon or bookshop org city of girls by elizabeth gilbert i loved this book so much and still think about it often elizabeth gilbert is just a genius the depths of her writing blow me away everything she s done is so different and she seems incapable of not writing a new york times bestseller ha ha the book follows vivian morris a year old vassar dropout to new york city through ups and downs and middle age all the way until she s years old she moves to the city to her aunt peg s house where she takes up costume design for glamorous showgirls spending most nights out on the town when she makes a terrible mistake her whole world implodes and she faces ruin but ultimately lands on her feet this is the story of female friendship of female sexuality of redemption and so much more i could not put it down order on amazon or bookshop org american royals by katharine mcgee just do yourself a favor and order this whole series as it is just so good and the third one is about to come out imagine if after the revolutionary war george washington became the king and not the president and then fast forward to modern day and write a book about the teenagers set to rule the palace there s princess beatrice the heir and her twin brother sister jefferson and samantha it s deliciously good reminiscent of the cast of the thousandth floor in the best way possible samantha is the wild child jefferson is the dreamy prince that every girl wants we also get to know the two girls vying for jefferson s heart manipulative daphne and down to earth nina order on amazon or bookshop org party of two by jasmine guillory i love all of jasmine guillory s books but this one is my favorite olivia s just moved to la to start her own law firm while staying in a hotel on her first night in town she chats up a handsome man at the hotel s bar when she gets up to her room she realizes she hadn t recognized him she d been talking to senator max powell this gives her a laugh at first but when they reconnect at a conference a few weeks later sparks fly and soon they are falling in love but can olivia handle the spotlight i love the famous person dates regular person trope i loved olivia as a character she s smart and funny and ultra relatable and i liked that the characters were my age sometimes reading romance novels about twenty somethings depresses me a little bit it was realistic it was sexy it was fun smart can t recommend it enough order on amazon or bookshop org the light we lost by jill santopolo some books just haunt you and this one broke my heart just thinking about it makes me all teary again it s about a young woman torn between the dreamy but flighty love of her life from her younger years and her stable loving husband there s gabe who she meets in college there s an instant spark they move in together and are so perfect together but their dreams take them in opposite directions gabe becomes a photojournalist heading to the middle east while lucy pursues a career and a life in new york the book spans years in which time lucy marries someone else and has children it s romantic and cripplingly sad at times and will stick with you after you read it i m not trying to make anyone cry at the beach but if you haven t read this yet you ll love it it s a great summer read order on amazon or bookshop org matchmaking for beginners by maddie dawson this was one of my top top books from and it would make for an absolutely fantastic summer read all marnie wants is an ordinary life the minivan the picket fence etc etc she s engaged to the man of her dreams and is on track to have everything she ever wanted then she meets blix holliday her fiance s eccentric great aunt a matchmaker living in brooklyn blix and her hit it off but blix is dying marnie s marriage ends up

friends of blix s and marnie learns that maybe she s the perfect person to follow blix s matchmaking footsteps i actually sobbed at the end of this book it s so sweet so heartwarming just so perfect order on amazon or bookshop org next year in havana by chanel cleeton i liken to the cuban version of the dollhouse another favorite it alternates between modern day and right before during after the revolution it s the story of elisa growing up very wealthy in cuba during the batista era her father a sugar baron and marisol her granddaughter marisol sets foot in cuba for the first time in her life at age to scatter the ashes of her beloved grandmother she gets to know the city she meets an alluring man and she uncovers some huge secrets that her grandmother had been hiding the author s description of cuba is so perfect that it made me feel like i was right back there i went several years ago and it was a favorite trip if you ve been to cuba it will make you nostalgic if you haven t you ll still enjoy it highly recommend order on amazon or bookshop org love and other words by christina lauren one of my favorite page turners i will start by saying how much i love christina lauren christina lauren is actually two friends and they are one of my favorite authors anything new they have out i will always pre order this one is a little bit reminiscent of the light we lost also on the list though less heartbreaking what happens when childhood sweethearts reconnect after ten years apart i love a high school to adults saga macy is ambitiously working on her career as a pediatrics assistant while planning her wedding to an older financially secure but terribly boring man everything unravels when she runs into elliot her first love we don t really understand why they were ever apart to begin with this will come out later everything dissolves and he s all she can think about honestly this book is an emotional rollercoaster in the best way possible there s a horrible secret there always is that comes out and a twist it kept me up all night and is the perfect beach read just make sure you don t have any distractions order on amazon or bookshop org the chiffon trenches by andr leon talley i get so jealous any time i see a friend reading this and it is brand new to them it s one of my all time favorite fashion memoirs a new york times bestseller for a reason and andr did not hold back on spilling the tea the book chronicles andr s rise from growing up in the jim crow south to moving to new york and working under andy warhol at interview magazine from there he wound up at wwd moved to paris then back to new york to vogue this book is positively dazzling when it was over i felt really sad to leave his glittery world besides all of the glamour and fashion it also tackles some more serious and timely things like racism the reason andr left wwd and paris was a terrible racist incident with a publicist at ysl it s simultaneously a frivolous distraction but also a really important book i absolutely loved it i have a book hangover upon finishing it order on amazon or bookshop org with the fire on high by elizabeth acevedo this will remain one of my favorite young adult books of all time and was a great summer read i read it on a yoga retreat in sag harbor several years ago when i opened up the book i was surprised and a little bummed that it was ya was this going to be another fluffy high school romance it is sort of but it s so much more than that it s about a teen mom emoni growing up in philly living with her grandmother and daughter emma the book opened up talking about why she gave her daughter a white name and how she hoped it would open up more chances for her the book is so sweet but all i could think about for so much of it was how privileged and lucky my own high school days were emoni is working multiple jobs dealing with racial bias and bias stares for having had a child so young all while trying to juggle the usual high school stuff friend drama boys school work applying to college order on amazon or bookshop org big summer by jennifer weiner i loved this book a perfect summer idea there are some fun parallels to my

heather cocks this is now an absolute classic i have been thinking about it a lot lately and kind of want to re read it just for fun or beg heather and jessica for a third book the sequel is excellent too this one will always and forever be an absolute favorite book of mine i never hold onto books after i read them but this has earned a permanent place on my shelf as i love it so much i am not a

who just happens to be the prince of england it follows them all the way through college and afterward through breakups an engagement the crazy royal wedding party and more it s juicy and fun and i
