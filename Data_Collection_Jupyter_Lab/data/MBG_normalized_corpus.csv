https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/read-this-if-you-dont-want-kids,2020-04-29,it s ok to not want kids it s ok if you don t want to be a parent and there s nothing wrong with you if that s the case it s also ok to not know yet whether you want to have kids one thing s for sure though feeling pressured and obsessing over what everyone else wants isn t going to help you make your decision the truth is you can be happy no matter what you choose although every person s journey is very personal here are three reasons why it s ok not to want to have kids for years i thought that deciding not to have kids would mean a bunch of awful things about myself i told myself that i should want to have kids and if i didn t have them then i d be less of a woman i d be missing out i wouldn t fit in and all of that would mean something was wrong with me now i see that it was all a story i was telling myself a completely optional story it s all subjective case in point i ve coached women who believed stories similar to the ones i used to tell myself and yet there are plenty of women who told themselves very different stories about their motherhood decision as illustrated in meghan daum s anthology selfish shallow and self absorbed sixteen writers on the decision not to have kids at the end of the day we can find evidence to support any story we tell so why not look for evidence to support beautiful stories about our lives stories that help us become the best versions of ourselves because as research professor dr bren brown says the most dangerous stories we make up are the narratives that diminish our inherent worthiness so let s say you decide not to have kids what will you make that mean and does that make you feel like crap regardless of what you choose you re the one who decides what stories you tell yourself choosing not to have kids doesn t have to mean anything horrible in fact it doesn t have to mean anything at all it can just be when s the last time you tried to make someone happy we re a funny bunch we humans thinking we can control other people s feelings because even though it s common to want to make people happy the reality is we can t make someone feel a certain way sure we can do what they want us to do and maybe make it easier for them to feel happy but any happiness they then feel is because of their own thoughts and their own stories many of you know this firsthand even when you do something to make someone else happy chances are it works for a moment and then they revert back to the same old problems that bothered them in the first place so if there s a person who desperately wants you to have a baby know that they ll be ok should you decide not to become a mother your not having kids could never make them feel bad just like your having kids could never make them feel good any emotions they feel will be created by their own thoughts and that s their own responsibility i recommend doing your best to feel good about how you communicate your decision and letting go of the rest let s say you decide not to have kids yet you hang on to the story that not wanting kids means something s wrong with you you re probably going to feel pretty crappy about your decision right but the great news is you can survive shame you can survive sadness you can survive regret and fear and any other emotion and not only that but you can learn to process any emotion in an efficient way a way that promotes healing and limits the pain you continue to cause yourself here s the best way i know to process any emotion so as you sit in your indecision know that everything is ok when you re ready you can land on your feet with confidence love and some serious self compassion regardless of what you choose even if you re experiencing frustrating indecision right now know that this experience is still important this is you realizing your own power in creating the life you want one you love deeply these statements have not been evaluated by the food and drug administration this product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease
https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/keep-clean-in-feng-shui-most-important-parts-of-home,2025-08-17,want to clean up a bit but short on time in feng shui these zones have the biggest impact on the overall energy and feel of your space clean and declutter them first before moving on to the rest of the home a home attracts its energy or chi through the front door that s why this area is probably the most important spot to get right in feng shui the more clean vibrant and welcoming the front door the better the quality of the chi for residents i decided to paint mine a bright orange color in order to attract vibrant energy bonus this color never looks dirty or aged but you can decorate your door according to the element that corresponds to the gua it s in here s an introduction to bagua maps if they re new to you and this resource will show you which gua your front door is located in lighting should be bright enough so that your porch or front door stand out make sure your house number is very visible from the street or if you live in an apartment visible from the hallway treat chi like a guest who is searching their way to your home a decluttered front entrance is important too in feng shui we call the entryway and the front door the mouth of chi similar to how we take in breath through our nostrils and airways we receive life force energy through the mouth of chi so it s essential to keep that area clean there s an old chinese tradition to sweep your entryway daily with a broom these days using your favorite vacuum works too even if your front door opens straight into the living area and you don t have a designated entryway i d still recommend creating a space that retains the energy of the door and prevents it from entering your home too fast a low bookshelf an area rug or a round console table with flowers on it can help establish this area the entryway gives a taste for the rest of the house so make sure it flows well and gives guests a sense of where they are expected to go in feng shui the kitchen can be compared to the heart of the home as it s where a home s warmth comes from a kitchen should not feel cold or have a cutting energy it should be cozy and inviting within the kitchen the stove is an appliance that requires daily attention since it s a symbol of prosperity it needs to be spotless so if you re using your stove daily which is also recommended in feng shui since cooking and sharing meals with family and friends attracts abundance it s important to clean it after use even if it s just a quick wipe down your home s mirrors and windows represent clarity of mind and prosperity so they should be kept clean and clear too wipe them down every couple of days or at least every week if you have kids and or pets or live in a dusty or rainy area i know it can be a pain but the satisfaction that comes with cleaning a window or mirror is just sublime in my experience doing so provides the brain with a quick burst of dopamine it s basically a healthier version of getting likes on instagram finally the condition of the center of the home affects whether or not your chi gets harmoniously distributed through the rest of the space vacuum and tidy up this area daily no clutter is allowed in the center as it gets in the way of chi and keeps it from providing harmonious energy to the different guas these statements have not been evaluated by the food and drug administration this product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease
https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/scientists-deem-ultra-processed-food-as-addictive,2024-03-07,ultra processed foods are as addictive as certain drugs and it s time to call out the dangers they pose to public health that s the strong stance that scientists and physicians took in an in depth analysis recently published in the british medical journal bmj in light of this report we were curious to dig into what exactly makes it so hard to stop eating the processed foods that inundate the inner aisles of grocery stores worldwide so we recruited an internal medicine physician and nutritionist to help us unpack this new analysis its significance and what it could mean for the future of food plenty of foods are processed before consumption they can be frozen roasted spiced and more so what exactly does ultra processed food mean ultra processed foods upfs can be loaded with ingredients many of which are sugar salt fat and other substances derived or extracted from real food think made in the lab and or additives such as artificial colors flavors and preservatives shapiro explains vinjamoori adds that ultra processed foods lack the essential nutrients we need to maintain optimal health i e protein fiber etc this is why consuming more upfs than whole or minimally processed foods can pose an overall health risk ultra processed foods are also nutrient poor meaning they lack essential vitamins minerals and other beneficial compounds and consistently consuming these foods can lead to nutritional deficiencies and inflammation which can shorten one s life span and lead to obesity and a variety of diseases vinjamoori states this level of processing is often used to boost sales of the product and preserve its shelf life as well as bring down the cost of production according to the bmj analysis addiction to these foods has become just as prevalent as addiction to other legal substances like alcohol and tobacco a recent analysis of two systematic reviews including studies from different countries found the overall pooled prevalence of food addiction using the yale food addiction scale was in adults and in children the authors state this prevalence is quite similar to the levels of addiction seen for other legal substances in adults noting for alcohol and for tobacco but the level of implied addiction in children is unprecedented they say in the full analysis the authors dive deep into the health and longevity implications of this addiction including higher rates of chronic diseases mental health and cognition concerns and worse treatment outcomes ultra processed foods aren t addictive just because they taste good their structure actually impacts the brain s reward centers the high carbohydrate and fat content in many upfs has a direct impact on the brain s dopamine pathways which play a role in reward and motivation the bmj analysis even noted that the spike in dopamine is so high that it s comparable to the rise seen with addictive substances such as nicotine and alcohol this isn t a mere analogy it s an acknowledgment of the real tangible impact these foods can have on our neurobiology in addition upfs can deliver carbs and fat to the brain very quickly further contributing to their addictive potential the faster a substance can reach the brain the more addictive it can be this is the rationale behind substitution therapies and why a cigarette which rapidly delivers nicotine to the brain is more addictive than a slow release nicotine transdermal patch the analysis authors explain this isn t a mere analogy it s an acknowledgment of the real tangible impact these foods can have on our neurobiology vinjamoori says he notes that we have more than enough compelling evidence on the health risks of ultra processed foods to warrant major change as for what we can do to reduce the risk of addiction to ultra processed foods the analysis includes four tangible recommendations as the popular saying goes actions speak louder than words and this analysis can only be considered a success if it inspires action that said many positive changes could come from this recommendation if put into motion if food addiction becomes an official diagnosis then there would likely be more opportunities for research around the topic shapiro says adding this could also improve insurance coverage and more access to professional support for those looking for help on the flip side she says that there is a stigma attached to being addicted to a substance even if it is food so the way we discuss addiction as a society would also have to change as we continue to uncover the mechanisms linking ultra processed foods to potential addictive behaviors there s a clear societal responsibility at hand vinjamoori adds not only do we need to transparently communicate these findings to the general public but we also must advocate for protective policies moreover it s imperative that we develop clinical resources and tools specifically designed to address food addiction finally there is another significant hurdle to cross before less processed diets can go mainstream economic and geographical inequities in the food system framing upfs as addictive may be a step in the right direction to encourage systemic change in the food industry and apply pressure for health care and health insurance to take nutrition more seriously which is great however until natural and minimally processed foods become more affordable and accessible than ultra processed foods there will always be a layer of inequality rooted in food access and nutrition choices nutrition scientists recently published a data analysis in the british medical journal with a suggestion to call out the addictive nature of ultra processed foods upfs and advocate for change in the food industry encouraging government regulation and public education the data shows that upfs affect the brain s dopamine receptors in a similar way and to a similar degree as addictive substances like nicotine and alcohol in part due to their carbohydrate to fat ratio these foods also lack the nutrients the human body needs to function properly which is another reason experts are concerned about the mass consumption of upfs in america the path to limiting the negative public health impacts of upfs is long complex and multifaceted but hopefully this bmj analysis will serve as a jumping off point for increased awareness and action throughout this process it will be essential for those advocating for change to acknowledge the economic disparities of food the recommendations provided in the analysis give us a glimpse into a world where access to whole nutrient dense food is a human right and that s definitely something worth working toward these statements
