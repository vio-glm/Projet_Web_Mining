In most cases, maternal health encompasses the health care dimensions of family planning , preconception , prenatal , and postnatal care in order to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience. In other cases, maternal health can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality . [ 1 ] Maternal health revolves around the health and wellness of pregnant individuals, particularly when they are pregnant, at the time they give birth, and during child-raising. WHO has indicated that even though motherhood has been considered as a fulfilling natural experience that is emotional to the mother, a high percentage of women develop health problems, sometimes resulting in death. [ 2 ] Because of this, there is a need to invest in the health of women. The investment can be achieved in different ways, among the main ones being subsidizing the healthcare cost, education on maternal health, encouraging effective family planning, and checking up on the health of individuals who have given birth. [ 3 ] Maternal morbidity and mortality particularly affects women of color and women living in low and lower-middle income countries.

The sport originated from military land-navigation training in the late 19th century. It has since evolved into several competitive forms where participants race against the clock while navigating through checkpoints. Variants include automobile , underwater , mountain bike , ski , and trail orienteering . The most common form is foot orienteering , also known as FootO . In formal foot-orienteering competitions, participants are given a specially prepared orienteering map , usually topographical, which they use to locate control points .

Pessimists tend to focus on the negatives of life in general. A common question asked to test for pessimism is "" Is the glass half empty or half full? ""; in this situation, a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty, or in extreme cases completely empty, while an optimist is said to see the glass as half full. Throughout history, the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking.

[ 5 ] It follows the Last Glacial Period , which concluded with the Holocene glacial retreat . [ 5 ] The Holocene and the preceding Pleistocene [ 6 ] together form the Quaternary period. The Holocene is an interglacial period within the ongoing glacial cycles of the Quaternary, and is equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage 1 . The name ""Holocene"" comes from Ancient Greek ὅλος ( hólos ), meaning ""whole"", and καινός ( kainós ), meaning ""new, recent"", referring that this epoch is ""entirely new"". The Holocene correlates with the last maximum axial tilt towards the Sun of the Earth's obliquity . The Holocene corresponds with the rapid proliferation, growth, and impacts of the human species worldwide, hence the Holocene is often commonly referred to as the Age of Humans , including all of its written history , technological revolutions , development of major civilizations , and overall significant transition towards urban living in the present. The human impact on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for the future evolution of living species, including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence, or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of the human impact. Following the extinction of most large terrestrial mammals outside of Africa during the preceding Late Pleistocene , the ecosystems of the Holocene continued to be impacted by extinctions (the ongoing Holocene extinction ), largely of human causation. In July 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene Epoch into three distinct ages based on the climate, Greenlandian (11,700 years ago to 8,200 years ago), Northgrippian (8,200 years ago to 4,200 years ago) and Meghalayan (4,200 years ago to the present), as proposed by the International Commission on Stratigraphy . [ 7 ] The oldest age, the Greenlandian, was characterized by a warming following the preceding ice age. The Northgrippian Age is known for vast cooling due to a disruption in ocean circulations that was caused by the melting of glaciers. The most recent age of the Holocene is the present Meghalayan, which began with extreme drought that lasted around 200 years.

Find sources: ""Etiology"" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( October 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Etiology ( / ˌ iː t i ˈ ɒ l ə dʒ i / ; alternatively spelled aetiology or ætiology ) is the study of causation or origination. The word is derived from the Greek word αἰτιολογία ( aitiología ) , meaning ""giving a reason for"" (from αἰτία ( aitía ) ' cause ' and -λογία ( -logía ) ' study of ' ). [ 1 ] More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves. [ 2 ] The word is commonly used in medicine (pertaining to causes of disease or illness) and in philosophy , but also in physics , biology , psychology , political science , geography , cosmology , spatial analysis and theology in reference to the causes or origins of various phenomena . In the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, myths often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or origin myth , is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, Virgil 's Aeneid is a national myth written to explain and glorify the origins of the Roman Empire . In theology , many religions have creation myths explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers.
