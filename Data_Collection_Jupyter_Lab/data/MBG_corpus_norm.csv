their well being routines covering everything from nutrition that makes them feel strong to the moments that bring them joy if you ve come across year old team usa rugby star ilona maher s tiktok videos you know how charming she can be considering her page has over million followers and million likes there s a good chance you ve come across a video or two if you re on the platform in fact when i shared that i d recently interviewed maher to a friend she gushed i love her tiktoks if you want to make a career out of rugby or if you want to make enough money as a professional athlete in rugby you have to have a social media presence i treat it as a second job if not right up there with my first job of being an athlete because at the spot we are as a sport and a women s sport i m not going to get too much of a livable income with just rugby she told me about why she s made social media a priority the rugby center s exploding popularity may be thanks to her social media prowess but make no mistake her strength will take center stage during this year s olympic games in paris as she gears up for her second olympics i was able to chat with her about how she stays strong what fuels her and why she wears lipstick on the field mindbodygreen what meals make you feel strongest ilona maher i don t feel bad about eating i ve been training my mind and training myself to get to that mindset even being a professional athlete but i think all women experience this we deal with eating and our bodies for me it s been really freeing to learn what foods it takes to be at my top performance the meals feel good when i know i need this food to fuel myself i m more about function versus form because right now i m supposed to be big i m supposed to be powerful and i m using these meals to do it but my favorite meals have to be the ones that my mom makes it s homey it s what i grew up on it s what kind of made me into the athlete i am today she can cook a steak like no one else and she makes this chicken satay that s amazing she marinates the chicken grills it and then makes this peanut butter sauce that you dip it in by the spoonful i would say that s my favorite mbg how do you mentally prepare for a game maher it s interesting because i try not to let rugby control my mind the whole time when people are like oh how do you do social media with the rugby but it s actually about finding that balance because if i was thinking about rugby all the time it would be a lot i think sometimes it can be a nice escape but to get into the game before it starts i do have to amp myself up it s such a hard sport i feel so tired constantly i m getting beat up out there and we play in these hot places i say to myself before i m about to run out if it were easy everybody would do it this is a very hard sport and i m so honored that i can do it it kind of puts it into perspective when i m tired it s also about connecting with my teammates and getting to do this with my best buddies mbg what s the most intense thing you ve ever tried to optimize your performance maher i don t know if this is really intense but heat training we play in such hot environments sometimes like singapore hong kong perth australia during heat waves and as high as degrees so we get into heat acclimation preparing yourself to be able to perform in that environment starts back home so even now i do heat acclimation just to prepare myself for summer in paris for example we ll sit in the sauna after we did a bike session in a heated room with sweatshirts and sweatpants on or we get into a hot tub with our sweatpants on mbg how do you rebound after a tough game maher that s been something i ve definitely been learning like constantly it never gets easier but you learn how to deal with it better in a way in the last olympics we lost and that was very hard but i ve been learning how to play it to my advantage after we lose one thing i focus on is connecting with my teammates because a lot of times people put things on themselves like oh i knocked that ball on or i missed that tackle that led to the loss it s important to remember that no one moment loses a game for us we have so many moments throughout a game and it s never that one moment like yeah maybe someone missed that tackle but what about earlier in the game when i missed it you re not out there alone and you re not losing on your own you re losing with this other group of women who are going through the same stuff so it s really important to be with them and connect with them laugh about it talk about the parts that went well the parts that went bad what to take from it mbg i wanted to ask you about teammates anyway one of the things that playing sports teaches us is how to be a good teammate and how to show up for other people so what makes a good teammate how do you show up for your teammates maher i think what s fun about being on a team is having those different personalities around you you need the person who is going to go quiet and wants to get in their head before a game or myself before a game i m loud i want to dance and i want to connect with people so it s important to recognize there are so many different teammates and personalities that make up a team and that s what makes a team special you don t want all the same athletes out there being a good teammate is also about helping others rise up as well for example what i ve been trying to do on social media has been for myself but it s also been for my teammates i try to bring them into any video i can or encourage them to post my teammate once told me a rising tide lifts all boats which is a great way to think about it it s about lifting up others lifting my teammates and making them feel good mbg the social media side of it is interesting because we re definitely in this moment in which women athletes are receiving more and much deserved attention and for many athletes social media can be a tool to ensure longevity in their career or after their career you mentioned earlier that it s about finding a balance between the two how do you find that balance maher i ve almost had to find a balance if you want to make a career out of rugby or if you want to make enough money as a professional athlete in rugby you have to have a social media presence i treat it as a second job if not right up there with my first job of being an athlete because at the spot we are as a sport and a women s sport i m not going to get too much of a livable income with just rugby i do get paid for rugby and it s amazing that i have that possibility for me in the u s but all of us want to make more money and all of us want to get sponsored and after the tokyo olympics i realized oh this is how i can do that i have to use this tool to my advantage my teammates and i talk about this all the time i want to make more money or i want to get sponsors and the thing is you have to post it s a very vulnerable state but you have to put yourself out there it s scary sometimes but i view it as this is how i make this career sustainable for a lot of athletes after they retire they just go back to regular jobs like this was all a fever dream of traveling the world to play rugby but i want to make this my career long term image by mbg creative courtesy of source mbg this touches on a topic i wanted to discuss anyway what are the double standards that exist for women versus men in rugby that you want to address maher well i think the first thing is that rugby is only a men s sport that it is so physical it s not meant for women and you have to be a man to play it and to play rugby as a woman there s this idea that you have to almost reject your femininity and go out there and be a masculine version of yourself and for a lot of sports that stops girls from playing because they ll think i don t want people to think of me this way or i don t want to risk my femininity or how beautiful i feel those misconceptions stop people from playing sports they stop people from really understanding what their body s capable of sports give your body a purpose that s not just to be looked at and objectified i think sports give you an appreciation for your body i think for me being that rugby athlete in the limelight i want to show that i can be this very big powerful person but i can also wear lipstick on the field to show that you can bring your femininity on the field too i know that in our seventh circuit now we have a lot of girls who put on a full face of makeup and who want to go out there and be pretty i love that because i don t think you have to sacrifice that to play this traditionally very manly sport i think what s cool about our game is that people are like oh well maybe it s not like the men s in every way it s different in some ways and different doesn t mean bad they re still both very exciting games to watch mbg that s a really important message because when you look at the research the reason young girls drop out of sports at a higher rate than boys is usually because of confidence issues so to show that you can be confident in both sides of yourself is really valuable speaking of embracing different sides of yourself i know you love beauty products what products do you love using right now maher i ve been using medalist which is a new brand that s by athletes for athletes we ve been testing out the products like no fric stick anti chafe cooling balm which i use on and off the field it s been really helpful for my pregame pre practice and after practice routine what i really love is that we re working with athletes of all abilities all sports and all disciplines athletes come in truly all shapes and sizes and need their skin care routines mbg being a professional athlete has a unique challenge of it being this thing you obviously love doing but is at the end of the day a high pressure job in what moments do you find that childlike joy again maher it s funny before practices we ll play fun games it s literally grown women you know some in our late s or s playing tag with each other we re laughing and giggling i made a joke that my friend just got married and bought a house but i m here playing tag with my friends in the sun but that brings me back to like why i love it i love the community of sports how it brings you in and how it makes you feel about yourself i think that those are the moments where i really get back to why i love rugby and love the people i get to do it with

https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/are-your-mushroom-supplements-helping-your-immune-system,are your mushroom supplements helping your immune system mindbodygreen skip to content accessibility statement paid content for are your mushroom supplements helping your immune system author devon barrow june branded content editor by devon barrow image by andrew thomas stocksy june so you ve been wondering about taking functional mushrooms to support your immune system it s a wise idea mushrooms are now well established for their inflammatory balancing and antioxidant properties plus they re full of proteins antioxidants and fatty acids all of which play a role in immunity these days the question is less about whether you re taking mushrooms and more about where you re getting them for the sake of your immune system you deserve the best the truth about your mushroom supplement if you re wondering what all the mushroom hype is about it starts with beta glucans these beneficial polysaccharides make up the cell walls of mushrooms and are connected to heart health gut health immune function inflammatory response and beyond research indicates that beta glucans and other beneficial components are found most abundantly in the mushroom s fruiting body that is everything aboveground however most mushroom supplements on the market today are made out of the mycelium or the root of the mushroom while mycelium certainly has its own benefits supplements made from the fruiting body guarantee you re getting the good stuff as far as quality goes gaia herbs pure extraction process sets the gold standard it starts with harvesting the fruiting bodies at their peak from there they dry and powder the mushrooms before concentrating them in hot water for five hours before capsulation this concentrated extract undergoes the same quality testing as the rest of their herbs to ensure potency purity and integrity with gaia herbs you get mushrooms which is harder to find than you d think image by gaia herbs contributor the case for fruiting bodies here s the issue with mushroom supplements made from mycelium mushrooms are often grown using grain substrates like rice or oats this substrate allows the mycelium or the roots to grow but it s difficult to extract because of that the growth substrate often ends up in the final product which means you re taking mushrooms but also added ingredients like fillers grain and starch not only does gaia herbs harvest their supplements from the fruiting body but they also get as close to a natural environment as possible their chaga for example is grown on siberian birch located on organically managed land their reishi is cultivated on beachwood log this paints a picture of the brand s commitment to sustainable sourcing it s also how you end up with a mushroom supplement how to choose the right mushroom for your immunity but returning to why a quality mushroom supplement really matters your immune system gets more bang for your buck and by that we mean more beta glucans for years vitamin c and zinc have been ruling our immunity routines but now that we know what mushrooms are capable of that s all changing all mushrooms are packed with health benefits but certain fungi are more connected to immune support than others need a little extra respiratory support or a helping hand for your liver not to worry there s a mushroom for that reishi reishi mushroom also known as the mushroom of immortality has been shown to support overall immune function as well as cardiovascular health if you re looking to boost your overall longevity gaia herbs reishi mushroom is your go to turkey tail researchers actually consider our liver an innate immunity organ due to its high concentration of immune cells gaia herbs turkey tail promotes healthy liver function and support as the most widely studied mushroom give this fun guy a front row spot in your supplement cabinet chaga chaga is known for offering antioxidant support and has long been used to prompt healthy cell turnover and gut health another key aspect of immunity gaia herbs everyday immune is formulated with chaga reishi and maitake another mushroom known for immune support combined with immune supporting herbs this everyday supplement checks all boxes the bottom line immunity can be one of those things you take for granted until you re feeling a little under the weather we re big believers that immunity isn t just something you focus on during winter or when you feel a bug coming on immunity is a lifestyle and choosing a high quality supplement like gaia herbs is how we can ensure we re giving our immune system its best chance remember your health deserves nothing less than transparent sourcing high quality

communication and media studies from fordham university a grand dipl me in culinary arts from the french culinary institute and master s degree in clinical nutrition and dietetics from new york university daily protein intake timing for weight loss pre vs post exercise morning vs evening types of protein powder recipes faq march protein is an essential macronutrient that fuels a lot more than just gains composing about of our body weight protein helps build teeny tiny cells large joints and organs and everything in between it plays a role in your energy levels immune function and metabolic health too your body is always breaking down protein so it needs a consistent supply from your diet but is there a certain time of the day that s considered best for refueling let s explore the best times to consume protein powder so it works the hardest for you why you should spread out your protein intake before you think about timing your protein to a tee you ll need to make sure you re getting enough of the macronutrient in the first place most active people will want to consume around to grams of protein per kilogram of body weight if you weigh pounds that s around to grams of protein per day by hitting this threshold you re ensuring that your body has enough protein to build muscle support metabolism and insulin sensitivity and more the most important part it seems based on the research is total protein intake in a day says shawn arent ph d a professor of exercise science at the university of south carolina you can time the crap out of your protein but if you re not eating enough per day it s a drop in the bucket ideally you ll be able to meet your protein needs by eating whole food protein sources however protein powders can be a convenient way to fill gaps in the diet and get a meaningful amount of protein without needing to fire up your stove rather than trying to cram grams of protein into one meal that s a lot of eggs and whey you ll want to spread your protein intake throughout the day starting with breakfast the first meal of the day is important because when you re sleeping your body is in a catabolic state in which muscle tissue is broken down for its constituent amino acids and you ll stay in this state until you replenish your body with the amino acids it needs to enter an anabolic state and rebuild muscle again a process called muscle protein synthesis mps the first meal after you re coming out of an overnight fast is absolutely critical don layman ph d a leading protein and amino acid researcher and professor at the university of illinois at urbana champaign previously told mindbodygreen until you have a meal that triggers mps you ll stay catabolic and what sets off mps and gets us into an anabolic state you guessed it protein layman s research has found that consuming an adequate serving of protein at least to grams starting at your first meal of the day will support muscle protein synthesis more effectively than eating the majority of your protein at dinner it will also set you up to fulfill that all important daily protein quota as long as you re consuming enough protein a day and spreading it across a few meals and snacks the exact hours of your protein intake don t matter as much however there are some ways to optimize your timing slightly depending on your specific goals summary before you think about protein timing you ll want to make sure you re eating enough protein per day upward of grams for most people and splitting it up across a few meals starting at breakfast aim for roughly grams of protein per meal protein to lose weight if you re looking to lose weight while maintaining muscle mass consuming protein powder in the morning can be beneficial not only will it kick start mps but protein is also highly satiating meaning it can help you start your day feeling full and satisfied it also has what s known as an insulinotropic effect so it helps clear glucose from your blood and can assist with stabilizing blood sugar less insulin spiking means more sustained energy levels and fewer hunger pangs throughout the day gabrielle lyon d o a functional medicine physician and the founder of the institute for muscle centric medicine previously told mindbodygreen in research on adolescents with obesity eating a high protein breakfast grams helped prevent fat gain and reduce daily hunger more than eating a lower protein breakfast or skipping breakfast altogether if fat loss is your goal you ll want to get plenty of exercise particularly strength training daily too pairing a protein rich diet with intermittent fasting has also been shown to promote fat loss and improved metabolic health in recent research likely due to the way that restricting your eating window can reduce calorie intake just note that this strategy is not effective for everybody and may be unsafe for pregnant and breastfeeding women or anyone with a history of an eating disorder talk to your doctor before trying it here is a complete guide to using protein powder for weight loss summary if you re looking to lose fat while building or maintaining muscle consuming protein in the morning and pairing it with exercise can help keep you more full and satisfied throughout the day should i consume protein before or after exercise there s a reason the stereotypical weightlifter follows up every gym session with a protein shake eating protein after a workout helps refuel the body and restore muscle tissue that was damaged during exercise the anabolic window of opportunity is the amount of time post workout that your body is primed to synthesize new proteins researchers used to think this time window was relatively short around to minutes but this notion has since been challenged the reality is that the window is more like a garage door it s much bigger than we thought it was arent explains if you don t eat protein right after a workout it s not like you re going to lose all the hard work you just put in so if you forgot to bring your shake to the gym it s fine to wait until you re home and showered to refuel with protein as well as some carbs whether you eat protein one hour after a workout or three research shows the effects on mps will be similar one exception is if you work out first thing in the morning without eating beforehand in that case you ll want to refuel quickly because you may still be in a more catabolic state as for the benefits of eating protein before a workout the research is more mixed and it seems to depend on the person there are some early studies suggesting that pre workout protein might be more important for women but we don t know for sure summary eating post workout seems to be more important for recovery and mps but if you prefer to sip a protein shake before the gym and it doesn t upset your stomach there s certainly no harm in doing so should i consume protein in the morning or at night as we ve already covered eating protein in the morning or during your first meal is key for getting your day off on the right foot however emerging research is also finding that consuming a concentrated dose of protein right before bed can be helpful for heavy exercisers one study published in frontiers of nutrition found that for those who were doing a prolonged period of resistance training consuming grams of protein before bed stimulated mps during the overnight recovery period a time when muscle would usually be breaking down this can also be a smart strategy for athletes with very high protein needs who would benefit from having one more protein heavy meal each day there is also some evidence though it s inconclusive that consuming protein right before bed can help older people combat age related muscle loss which is a concern after the age of or so if you opt to consume protein shortly before bed be sure to choose a protein powder that s easy to digest and won t disrupt your sleep slow digesting casein protein is a popular choice related read the best time to take vitamins supplements a scannable guide summary if you re going to choose one or the other drinking protein powder in the morning will be more beneficial for most people however athletes and those with very high protein needs may also get added benefits from protein right before bed types of protein powder as arent puts it you can look at your protein routine like a birthday cake your total protein intake is the cake itself and it sets the foundation protein timing is like the icing and in this scenario the protein type is the candle on top to maximize your recovery and growth you ll want to opt for a protein source that contains all the essential amino acids in the correct amounts you should pay particular attention to leucine which is known as an anabolic trigger because of its ability to switch on mps but they re all important leucine starts the igniter but you still have to have sufficient amounts of the other amino acids to keep protein synthesis going says matthew e stark m s rdn ldn the program coordinator of nutrition and dietetics at northern illinois university if you re low on one that could stunt the protein synthesis even though you did have sufficient leucine animal proteins tend to be higher in leucine than plant proteins but a well formulated plant protein powder can hit the leucine threshold needed to spur mps around grams per serving there are many types of protein powders available each with its own pros and cons and you can learn all about the most popular here when shopping for the right protein powder for you be it whey isolate or pea protein be sure to look for one that has at least to grams of protein per serving has a healthy amino acid composition is sustainably sourced comes from a reputable company and is low on additives and extra sugars mbg s picks for clean protein powders mt capra clean whey protein antler farms new zealand whey protein isolate truvani organic vanilla plant based protein powder creative ways to consume protein powder we ve established that protein is essential throughout the day from morning until night if you re looking to use protein powder to up your daily protein intake here are some creative ways to do so beyond just another smoothie or shake breakfast add it to your overnight oats or hot oatmeal add flavored protein to coffee add it to the batter of your waffles or pancakes snack add it to your brownie or cookie batter whip up a collagen pudding use it to make energy balls dinner swirl unflavored protein into mashed potatoes or yogurt mix it into salad dressing faq is it better to drink a protein shake before or after workout drinking a protein shake after a workout will go a longer way in supporting recovery and muscle protein synthesis but you don t need to rush to drink it right away the anabolic window is longer than previously thought so just aim to consume protein within a few hours of exercise should i take protein powder every day you should be consuming enough protein every day but it doesn t need to be in powder form but if you struggle to meet your daily protein requirements with food alone consuming protein powder every day is a safe way to supplement should i drink protein shakes on non workout days your body always needs protein even on rest days and if a protein shake helps you fulfill your daily quota you should still drink it even on days you don t work out it s a myth that eating protein without working out makes you gain weight learn why here the takeaway as long as you re getting enough protein each day the timing of your protein doesn t matter as much however there are a few times throughout the day like in the morning and after a workout when drinking a protein shake may be even more beneficial for muscle growth and recovery sources https academic oup com ajcn article https pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc https pubmed ncbi

fitness studio tried countless different virtual programs and nothing has stuck like the katie austin app while i tend to get bored very easily and like to change it up i love how i can either do a katie austin app quickie at home outside or challenge myself to do a quick core or ab workout in the sauna for an extra burn the recipes are also amazing but i d be lying if i didn t say that her workouts are my absolute favorite part about the app growing up overweight diagnosed pre diabetic at and down almost pounds to date i always thought that you had to workout for hours a day and stay in
