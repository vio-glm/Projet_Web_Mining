https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCCN_(identifier),"The Library of Congress Control Number ( LCCN ) is a serially based system of numbering cataloged records in the Library of Congress , in the United States. It is not related to the contents of any book, and should not be confused with Library of Congress Classification (LCC). The LCCN numbering system has been in use since 1898, at which time the initialism LCCN originally stood for Library of Congress Card Number. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It has also been called the Library of Congress Catalog Card Number, among other names. The Library of Congress prepared cards of bibliographic information for their library catalog and would sell duplicate sets of the cards to other libraries for use in their catalogs. This is known as centralized cataloging. Each set of cards was given a serial number to help identify it. Although most of the bibliographic information is now electronically created, stored, and shared with other libraries, there is still a need to identify each unique record, and the LCCN continues to perform that function. Librarians all over the world use this unique identifier in the process of cataloging most books which have been published in the United States. It helps them reach the correct cataloging data (known as a cataloging record), which the Library of Congress and third parties make available on the Web and through other media. In February 2008, the Library of Congress created the LCCN Permalink service, providing a stable URL for all LCCNs that have not been suppressed. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Although an item might have an assigned LCCN, it will not be associated with a record (i.e., not used in permalink, not useful in search tool) if it was removed from the collection or never added to it. [ 5 ] The two basic elements of an LCCN are a year and a serial number."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health,"Maternal health is the health of women during pregnancy , childbirth , and the postpartum period . In most cases, maternal health encompasses the health care dimensions of family planning , preconception , prenatal , and postnatal care in order to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience. In other cases, maternal health can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality . [ 1 ] Maternal health revolves around the health and wellness of pregnant individuals, particularly when they are pregnant, at the time they give birth, and during child-raising. WHO has indicated that even though motherhood has been considered as a fulfilling natural experience that is emotional to the mother, a high percentage of women develop health problems, sometimes resulting in death. [ 2 ] Because of this, there is a need to invest in the health of women. The investment can be achieved in different ways, among the main ones being subsidizing the healthcare cost, education on maternal health, encouraging effective family planning, and checking up on the health of individuals who have given birth. [ 3 ] Maternal morbidity and mortality particularly affects women of color and women living in low and lower-middle income countries. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] WHO estimates that about 295,000 maternal deaths occurred in 2017. [ 6 ] The causes of these maternal deaths range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour, all of which have highly effective interventions. Further, indirect causes of maternal mortality include anemia and malaria. [ 6 ] As women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendance with backup emergency obstetric care, the global maternal mortality has fallen by about 44 percent, which represented a decline of about 2.3 percent annually over the period from 1990 to 2015. While there has been a decline in worldwide mortality rates after much effort, high rates still exist, particularly in low and middle income countries (99%). Sub-saharan Africa accounts for approximately two thirds of these deaths and South Asia accounts for about one-fifth of them. [ 7 ] One third of the maternal deaths occur in India and Nigeria. [ 8 ] The mother's death results in vulnerable families, and their infants , if they survive childbirth, are more likely to die before reaching their second birthday. [ 9 ] Both maternal mortality (death) and severe maternal morbidity (illness) are ""associated with a high rate of preventability."" [ 10 ] In 2010, the U.S. Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations described maternal mortality as a "" sentinel event "", and uses it to assess the quality of a health care system. [ 11 ] Subsidizing the cost of healthcare helps to improve the health status of women. In countries such as the U.S, U.K, and others, government and non-governmental bodies work to reduce and even eliminate fees for pregnant women or women who have health issues related to pregnancy. When women deliver their babies in certified healthcare facilities without paying or paying a very small amount, they can use their money on the diet of the baby, clothing, and other needs. [ 12 ] Also, when women attend clinics without charge and are issued free supplements, their health is maintained, and this reduces the monetary resources that the government invests in healthcare. In turn, the maternal morbidity rate, together with mortality rates, is lowered. [ 13 ] Education on issues related to maternal health is essential to control and improve the healthcare of women. Women who have resources have a low chance of their health status deteriorating, due to their knowledge. These women are informed to make decisions regarding family planning, the best time to give birth as far as their financial capabilities are concerned, and their nutrition, before, during, and after giving birth. Additionally, many approaches involve women, families, and local communities as active stakeholders in interventions and strategies to improve maternal health. [ 14 ] Gannon (n.p) reports that the maternal rate of mortality dropped by 70% between 1946 and 1953, when women began receiving maternal education. The study recommended that the focus should be on communities that are marginalized and girls who are under the age of 18. When the government manages to reduce unwanted and unplanned pregnancies among these two groups of people, it becomes easier to reduce maternal health problems and the cost associated with them. [ citation needed ] According to a UNFPA report, social and economic status, culture norms and values, and geographic remoteness all increase maternal mortality, and the risk for maternal death (during pregnancy or childbirth) in sub-Saharan Africa is 175 times higher than in developed countries, and risk for pregnancy-related illnesses and negative consequences after birth is even higher. [ 15 ] Poverty , maternal health, and outcomes for the child are all interconnected. [ 16 ] Women living in poverty-stricken areas are more likely to be obese and engage in unhealthy behaviors such as cigarette smoking and substance use, are less likely to engage in or even have access to legitimate prenatal care, and are at a significantly higher risk for adverse outcomes for both the mother and child. [ 17 ] A study conducted in Kenya observed that common maternal health problems in poverty-stricken areas include hemorrhaging, anemia , hypertension , malaria, placenta retention, premature labor , prolonged/complicated labor, and pre-eclampsia . [ 18 ] Generally, adequate prenatal care encompasses medical care and educational, social, and nutritional services during pregnancy. [ 21 ] For example, prenatal care could include serum integrated screening tests for potential chromosomal abnormalities as well as blood pressure measurements, or uterus measurements to assess fetal growth. Although there are a variety of reasons women choose not to engage in proper prenatal care, 71% of low-income women in a US national study had difficulties getting access to prenatal care when they sought it out. [ 21 ] Additionally, immigrants and Hispanic women are at higher risk than white or black women for receiving little to no prenatal care, where level of education is also an indicator (since education and race are correlated). Adolescents are least likely to receive any prenatal care at all. Throughout several studies, women and adolescents ranked inadequate finances and lack of transportation as the most common barriers to receiving proper prenatal care. [ 22 ] Income is strongly correlated with quality of prenatal care. [ 22 ] Sometimes, proximity to healthcare facilities and access to transportation have significant effects on whether or not women have access to prenatal care. An analysis conducted on maternal healthcare services in Mali found that women who lived in rural areas, far away from healthcare facilities were less likely to receive prenatal care than those who lived in urban areas. Furthermore, researchers found an even stronger relationship between lack of transportation and prenatal and delivery care. [ 23 ] In addition to proximity being a predictor of prenatal care access, Materia and colleagues found similar results for proximity and antenatal care in rural Ethiopia. [ 24 ] Also, inadequate and poor quality services contributes in increasing maternal morbidity and mortality. [ 25 ] Pre-existing (pregestational) maternal Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes is a known factor that increases the risk of adverse outcomes, including pre-term birth, preeclampsia, and congenital birth defects. [ 26 ] Studies from the United States and Australia indicate that the prevalence of pregestational diabetes is around 1% of pregnancies. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Even healthy pregnancy causes a state of hyperglycemia. As a result, mothers with pregestational diabetes are at an increased risk for hyperglycemia. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Maternal HIV rates vary around the world, ranging from 1% to 40%, with African and Asian countries having the highest rates. [ 30 ] Whilst maternal HIV infection largely has health implications for the child, [ 31 ] especially in countries where poverty is high and education levels are low, [ 32 ] having HIV/AIDS while pregnant can also cause heightened health risks for the mother. [ 33 ] A large concern for HIV-positive pregnant women is the risk of contracting tuberculosis (TB) and/or malaria, in developing countries. [ 30 ] 28% of maternal deaths are from obstructed labour and indirect causes, meaning diseases that complicate pregnancy or that are complicated by pregnancy (malaria, anemia, HIV/AIDS, and cardiovascular diseases). [ 8 ] During pregnancy, women of an average pre-pregnancy weight ( BMI 18.5-24.9) should expect to gain between 25–35 pounds (11–16 kg) over the course of the pregnancy. [ 34 ] Increased rates of hypertension, diabetes, respiratory complications, and infections are prevalent in cases of maternal obesity and can have detrimental effects on pregnancy outcomes. [ 35 ] Obesity is an extremely strong risk factor for gestational diabetes . [ 36 ] Research has found that obese mothers who lose weight (at least 10 pounds or 4.5 kg) between pregnancies reduce the risk of gestational diabetes during their next pregnancy, whereas mothers who gain weight actually increase their risk. [ 37 ] Women who are pregnant should aim to exercise for at least 150 minutes per week, including muscle strengthening exercises. [ 38 ] However, it is recommended that pregnant women discuss what exercise they can do safely with their OB/GYN in the early prenatal period. [ 39 ] Vigorous Exercise The current guidelines for moderate intensity activity during pregnancy have been outlined by organizations such as the WHO and ACOG to be the same 150 minutes per week as regular physical activity guidelines. [ 40 ] Certain modifications such as avoiding supine position after 20 weeks are also recommended. [ 40 ] Vigorous activity guidelines during pregnancy have not been outlined as clearly or studied as much, so consulting a healthcare professional to get a safe, tailored, fitness plan is recommended. Current research supports that vigorous activity for most non-complicated singleton pregnancies is beneficial and has little negative impact on fetal wellbeing. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] It has also been shown to have similar benefits to those who perform the same level of activity outside of pregnancy. [ 42 ] The concerns related to high intensity exercise during pregnancy are usually around fetal wellbeing measures such as heart rate and blood flow. No abnormal measures of fetal distress, such as heart rate or maternal/fetal blood flow [ 41 ] were found during high intensity/vigorous exercise, if the mother stayed under 90% of her heart rate maximum. [ 42 ] [ 41 ] Risks of exceeding this heart rate included decreased uterine artery blood flow and fetal bradycardia. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] If using vigorous exercise as a means of lowering maternal weight gain during pregnancy, it's important to note there is little evidence to suggest that higher intensity has more of an effect than moderate intensity activity on normal pregnancies; [ 43 ] [ 42 ] It was shown in one study that the obese/overweight population during pregnancy had improved maternal weight gain with more vigorous exercise compared to moderate although more studies are needed. [ 43 ] When related to birth outcome measures such as mode of delivery, pain control, and duration all were unaffected when compared to moderate intensity. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] High intensity exercises such as stationary biking, uphill running, cross country skiing, and resistance circuit training, all showed similar benefits. [ 43 ] [ 42 ] It is important to further study the effects and limitations of vigorous exercise during pregnancy as it becomes more prevalent for female athletes, and in the average population. Overall if one is already performing vigorous activity before pregnancy, no negative effects were found with the continuation of similar activity levels during pregnancy, if staying under 90% of the mothers heart rate maximum. [ 41 ] [ 43 ] [ 42 ] Always consult a physician to ensure any physical activity performed is safe during pregnancy, as the recommended amount of physical activity can depend on other factors during pregnancy as well. During and after pregnancy, mothers should receive continuous care from a physician, in-person or via telehealth depending on the need, [ 44 ] to monitor the growth and status of the fetus. Maternal health organizations suggest that at a minimum pregnant women should receive one ultrasound at week 24 to help predict any possible growth anomalies and prevent future gestational concerns. [ 45 ] It is also stated that pregnant women should also fulfill any missing vaccinations as soon as possible including the tetanus vaccine and influenza vaccine. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] For pregnant women who are at an increased risk for Pre-eclampsia , one could take a dietary supplement of low dose aspirin as prophylaxis before 20 weeks gestation. [ 45 ] Pregnant women should also monitor their blood sugars as they are able to monitor the potential development of gestational diabetes. Other prenatal screening tests include serum integrated protein tests, cell free DNA blood tests to check for chromosomal abnormalities, and nuchal translucency ultrasounds. If their medical system is able to provide them, mothers can also undergo more invasive diagnostic tests such as an amniocentesis, or chorionic villous sampling to detect abnormalities with greater accuracy. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Analysis of the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), indicates significant racial and ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related deaths. [ 50 ] The pregnancy-related mortality ratio (PRMR) represents the number of deaths per 100,000 live births resulting from pregnancy or pregnancy-related causes. A 2019 report from the CDC shows that the PRMRs of Black women and Indigenous women in the United States are 3-4 times higher than that of White women. White women had a PRMR of approximately 13 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. While Black and Indigenous women had PRMRs of 41 and 30 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, respectively. The majority of these deaths were due to preventable diseases associated with pregnancy, such as hypertension. While the fatality rate of these diseases was higher among Black and Indigenous women, the initial prevalence was generally the same across all races. [ 51 ] The Maternal Vulnerability Index (MVI) tool, which measures risk factors on a county-by-county basis in the U.S., confirms the racial disparities in maternal health outcomes. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Although lower than that of Black and Indigenous women, the PRMR for Asian and Pacific Islander women was still slightly higher than that of the White women at 13.5. [ 51 ] The PRMR for Hispanic women has shown a decline in recent years. However, state-specific reports show that Hispanic women still face high rates of maternal morbidity, or health problems that arise from pregnancy and birth. [ 54 ] The CDC cites multiple causes for the racial gap in maternal mortality. They say that most pregnancy-related deaths are the combined result of 3-4 contributing factors. Some of these factors include higher rates of chronic conditions in minority communities, [ 55 ] lower rates of prenatal care, [ 56 ] and lower rates of insurance coverage. [ 56 ] Furthermore, teen pregnancy rates are higher in minority communities, which is a risk factor for pregnancy or birth complications. [ 56 ] Black and Indigenous women can also encounter racial bias held by healthcare providers, which affects the quality of care given to treat or prevent a fatal disease. For example, an NIH report states that Black women are two to three times more likely to die of hemorrhage or embolisms during pregnancy or the postpartum period. [ 57 ] Outside of provider-patient interactions, structural factors can contribute to the racial gap in maternal mortality. This includes the gap in access to primary and preventative care as well as other social determinants of health such as education and community support. [ 56 ] Chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and hypertension can cause pregnancy complications and maternal morbidity, and these conditions arise from the effects of the weathering hypothesis . [ 58 ] The weathering hypothesis also states a higher rate of preterm birth among Black pregnant people in the United States, which is not only dangerous for the baby but also has effects on the birth parent. A Black birth parent of a preterm baby is more likely to experience high blood pressure following a preterm birth and subsequent higher rates of coronary artery calcification. [ 59 ] There are many factors that influence maternal health and the access of resources. One of these factors that recent studies have highlighted is religion. For example, one such study stated that, due to the insensitivity and lack of knowledge that physicians showed immigrant Muslim women in Canada, their health information and treatment suffered. [ 60 ] The health care that they received from physicians did not provide information in respect to their religious or cultural practices and did little to provide cultural adjustments and emotional support. [ 60 ] In order to provide a safer and more comfortable environment for Muslim women, it was proven that they needed more support that would connect with the immigrant community and health-related information. [ 60 ] Discrimination based on religion is a factor that effects the maternal health care of women from different backgrounds. There is not a lot of discussion on the studies that reflect the hardships that women go through in terms of their religion and maternal care. Stigmatizing certain maternal and reproductive practices is common within the context of religion. For example, in a study that focused on interviewing women who have had abortions, one participant used the word ""guilt"" 16 times in her one-hour interview. [ 61 ] She cited that the cause of her guilt was because of her Catholic upbringing. [ 61 ] The overall data showed that there was a strong relationship between religion and self-stigma. [ 61 ] Among the women who identified as a practicing Christian, 65% made statements that proved self-stigma effects. [ 61 ] There is a lot of stigma and norms regarding religion that, in turn, place women at risk when receiving health-care. [ 62 ] Other religious practices and traditions have shown to influence maternal health in a negative way. Practitioners of apostolicism in Zimbabwe have been associated with higher maternal mortality. [ 63 ] Results of a study showed the dangerous associations that religion may have on maternal health. [ 63 ] The general trend shows that Apostolicism promotes high fertility, early marriage, non-use of contraceptives and low or non-use of hospital care. [ 63 ] There are delays in recognizing danger signs, deciding to seek care and receiving appropriate health care. [ 63 ] Future studies can look at how societal traditions or expectations such as gender roles may combine with religion to result in poorer maternal health care. [ citation needed ] Although factors of religion can negatively influence maternal health care, other studies show the necessity of understanding different religious beliefs and practices. In Ghana, interviews of women showed the benefits of transparent religious beliefs and practices while pregnant and in labor. [ 64 ] Spiritual interventions done by pastors in pregnancy included prayer, revelations, reversing negative dreams, laying of hands and anointing women. [ 64 ] Religious artifacts used among the women during pregnancy and labor were anointing oil, blessed water, stickers, blessed white handkerchief, blessed sand, Bible and Rosary. [ 64 ] The women made many connections to these practices and to their religion such as God having the capability to reduce labor pain and to provide a safe and successful delivery. [ 64 ] The results concluded that spirituality is an integral part of the care of pregnant women in Ghana. [ 64 ] In order to ensure the safety of these women, their religious practices should not be in secrecy. [ 64 ] The presence of artifacts implies that women do not have the freedom to practice their religion at home. [ 64 ] It was concluded that pastors should be sensitive to their role in the labor process and that revelations and spiritual interventions should not lead to pregnancy or labor complications. [ 64 ] Future studies in religion and maternal health care will focus on the role of pastors, familiar support, and the views of midwives or health care professionals in different societies around the world. Prenatal care is an important part of basic maternal health care. [ 65 ] It is recommended expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal healthcare visits, in which a health worker can check for signs of illness – such as underweight, anaemia or infection – and monitor the health and status of the fetus. [ 66 ] During these visits, women are counselled on nutrition and hygiene to optimize their health prior to, and following, delivery. These visits can also include health maintenance of any pre-existing health conditions the woman may have had prior to becoming pregnant - such as diabetes, hypertension, or renal disease. In collaboration with her healthcare provider, the patient can develop a birth plan which outlines how to reach care and what to do in the event of an emergency. [ citation needed ] The model CenteringPregnancy (group prenatal care) is a relatively new addition to prenatal healthcare, and has shown to improve both birth outcomes and patient & provider satisfaction. [ 67 ] Specifically, a randomized controlled trial indicated a 33 percent reduction in preterm birth (n=995), and the decrease was even more pronounced for Black/African American participants. [ 68 ] CenteringPregnancy provides physical exams, education, and peer support to a group of pregnant women who all have a similar due date. [ 67 ] Research in race concordant group prenatal care (like the EMBRACE group at UCSF) has not yet been researched enough to indicate improved outcomes. [ 69 ] Nonetheless, race concordant care has been proven to improve patient experience [ 70 ] and patient & provider communication. [ 71 ] Newborn-physician racial concordance was significantly associated with mortality improvements for black infants in 2020, [ 72 ] but debunked in 2024. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Poverty, malnutrition, and substance use may contribute to impaired cognitive, motor, and behavioral problems across childhood. [ 75 ] In other words, if a mother is not in optimal health during the prenatal period (the time while she is pregnant) and/or the fetus is exposed to teratogen(s), the child is more likely to experience health or developmental difficulties, or death. The environment in which the mother provides for the embryo/fetus is critical to its wellbeing well after gestation and birth. A teratogen is ""any agent that can potentially cause a birth defect or negatively alter cognitive and behavioral outcomes."" [ 76 ] Dose, genetic susceptibility, and time of exposure are all factors for the extent of the effect of a teratogen on an embryo or fetus. [ 77 ] Prescription drugs taken during pregnancy such as streptomycin, tetracycline, some antidepressants, progestin, synthetic estrogen, and Accutane, [ 78 ] [ 79 ] as well as over-the-counter drugs such as diet pills, can result in teratogenic outcomes for the developing embryo/fetus. Additionally, high dosages of aspirin are known to lead to maternal and fetal bleeding, although low-dose aspirin is usually not harmful. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Newborns whose mothers use heroin during the gestational period often exhibit withdrawal symptoms at birth and are more likely to have attention problems and health issues as they grow up. [ 82 ] Use of stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine during pregnancy are linked to a number of problems for the child such as low birth weight and small head circumference, motor and cognitive developmental delays, as well as behavioral problems across childhood. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry found that six-year-olds whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy scored lower on an intelligence test than children whose mothers had not. [ 87 ] Cigarette smoking during pregnancy can have a multitude of detrimental effects on the health and development of the offspring. Common results of smoking during pregnancy include pre-term births, low birth weights, fetal and neonatal deaths, respiratory problems, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), [ 77 ] as well as increased risk for cognitive impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other behavioral problems. [ 88 ] Also, in a study published in the International Journal of Cancer, children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy experienced a 22% risk increase for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. [ 89 ] Although alcohol use in careful moderation (one to two servings a few days a week) during pregnancy are not generally known to cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), the US Surgeon General advises against the consumption of alcohol at all during pregnancy. [ 90 ] Excessive alcohol use during pregnancy can cause FASD, which commonly consist of physical and cognitive abnormalities in the child such as facial deformities, defective limbs, face, and heart, learning problems, below average intelligence, and intellectual disability (ID). [ 91 ] [ 92 ] Although HIV/AIDS can be transmitted to offspring at different times, the most common time that mothers pass on the virus is during pregnancy. During the perinatal period, the embryo/fetus can contract the virus through the placenta. [ 77 ] Gestational diabetes is directly linked with obesity in offspring through adolescence. [ 93 ] Additionally, children whose mothers had diabetes are more likely to develop Type II diabetes . [ 94 ] Mothers who have gestational diabetes have a high chance of giving birth to very large infants (10 pounds (4.5 kg) or more). [ 77 ] This is a cause of macrosomia. Neonates with macrosomia have significantly increased rates of hypoglycemia compared to infants of mothers without diabetes. This is because macrosomic neonates are used to high levels of circulating blood sugars in utero, which results in naturally high levels of insulin. At birth, when the gestational source of blood sugar is abruptly removed, this causes the neonates to experience severe drops in blood sugar. [ 95 ] Because the embryo or fetus's nutrition is based on maternal protein, vitamin, mineral, and total caloric intake, infants born to malnourished mothers are more likely to exhibit malformations. Additionally, maternal stress can affect the fetus both directly and indirectly. When a mother is under stress, physiological changes occur in the body that could harm the developing fetus. Additionally, the mother is more likely to engage in behaviors that could negatively affect the fetus, such as tobacco smoking , substance use, and alcohol use. [ 77 ] Genital herpes , rubella, cytomegalovirus, varicella, parvovirus B19, and enteroviruses can be passed to the baby through the birth canal during delivery. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] In pregnancies where the mother is infected with the virus, 25% of babies delivered through an infected birth canal become brain damaged, and 1/3 die. [ 77 ] HIV/AIDS can also be transmitted during childbirth through contact with the mother's body fluids or transmission to the fetus via the placenta. [ 77 ] Mothers in developed countries may often elect to undergo a caesarean section to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus through the birth canal, but this option is not always available in developing countries. [ 99 ] Globally, more than eight million of the 136 million women giving birth each year have excessive bleeding after childbirth. [ 100 ] This condition—medically referred to as postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)—causes one out of every four maternal deaths that occur annually and accounts for more maternal deaths than any other individual cause. [ 100 ] Deaths due to postpartum hemorrhage disproportionately affect women in developing countries. For every woman who dies from causes related to pregnancy, an estimated 20 to 30 encounter serious complications. [ 66 ] At least 15 per cent of all births are complicated by a potentially fatal condition. [ 66 ] Women who survive such complications often require lengthy recovery times and may face lasting physical, psychological, social and economic consequences. Although many of these complications are unpredictable, almost all are treatable. Findings from a 2023 systematic review of the literature have found a relationship between health insurance coverage and postpartum outcomes, suggesting that those with little to no coverage have increased negative postpartum health outcomes. [ 101 ] . During the postpartum period , many mothers breastfeed their infants. Transmission of HIV/AIDS through breastfeeding is a huge issue in developing countries , namely in African countries. [ 99 ] The majority of infants who contract HIV through breast milk do so within the first six weeks of life, [ 102 ] despite that antiretroviral treatment (during pregnancy, delivery and during breastfeeding) reduces transmission risk by >90%. However, in healthy mothers, there are many benefits for infants who are breastfed. The World Health Organization recommends that mothers breastfeed their children for the first two years of life, whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend that mothers do so for at least the first six months, and continue as long as is mutually desired. [ 103 ] Infants who are breastfed by healthy mothers (not infected with HIV/AIDS) are less prone to infections such as Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneunoniae, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Giardia lamblia , group B streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis , rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and herpes simplex virus-1, as well as gastrointestinal and lower respiratory tract infections and otitis media. Lower rates of infant mortality are observed in breastfed babies in addition to lower rates of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Decreases in obesity and diseases such as childhood metabolic disease, asthma, atopic dermatitis, Type I diabetes, and childhood cancers are also seen in children who are breastfed. [ 103 ] Following up on the women who have given birth is a crucial factor as it helps check on maternal health. Since healthcare facilities have records of the women who have given birth, when the women are followed to monitor the progress of their babies as well as their health, it becomes easy to put them on a follow-up and ensure they are doing well as the baby grows. Follow-up is accompanied by nutritional advice to ensure both the mother and her baby are in good condition. This prevents sickness that may affect the two and deteriorate their health. Additionally, longitudinal followup must include mental health support and screening, as roughly 15% of women will experience postpartum depression , also known as ""baby blues"", within the first year of birth, although it typically starts in the first 1–3 weeks after birth. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Maternal health care and care of the fetus starts with prenatal health. The World Health Organization suggests that the first step towards health is a balanced diet which includes a mix of vegetables, meat, fish, nuts, whole grains, fruits and beans. [ 45 ] Additionally, iron supplements and folic acid are recommended to be taken by pregnant women daily. These supplements are recommended by the US Surgeon General to help prevent birth complications for mothers and babies such as low birth weight, anemia, hypertension and pre-term birth. [ 107 ] [ 45 ] [ 108 ] Folic acid can aid neural tube formation in a fetus, which happens early in gestation and therefore should be recommended as soon as possible. [ 109 ] Calcium and Vitamin A supplements are also recommended when those compounds are not available or only available in low doses in the natural diet but other supplements such as Vitamins D, E, C, and B6 are not recommended. [ 109 ] The WHO also suggests that low impact exercise and reduction of caffeine intake to less than 330 mg/day can help to reduce the likelihood of neonatal morbidity. [ 45 ] Light exercise should be continued for pregnant mothers as it has been recommended to combat negative health outcomes, side effects and birth complications related to obesity. [ 107 ] The overturned advice that pregnant women's heartate should not exceed 140 as of 2012 was still popularly believed. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] Should possible side effects of a pregnancy occur, such as nausea, vomiting, heartburn, leg cramps, lower back pain, and constipation; low intensity exercise, balanced diet, or natural herb supplements are recommended by the WHO to mitigate the side effects. [ 45 ] the US Surgeon General recommends abstaining from consuming alcohol or nicotine in any form throughout the duration of one's pregnancy, and to avoid using it as a way to mitigate some of the side effects of pregnancy mentioned earlier. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] In the case of a healthy vaginal birth, mothers and babies typically are recommended to stay at the hospital for 24 hours before departing. This is suggested to allow time to assess the mother and child for any possible complications such as bleeding or additional contractions. The WHO recommends that babies should have checkups with a physician on day 3, day 7-14 and 6 weeks after birth. [ 45 ] At these follow-up appointments the emotional well-being of the mother should also be considered. Special attention to the possibility of postpartum depression , which affects 10-15% of mothers in 40 countries is also recommended by the WHO. [ 114 ] A 2021 systematic review of found that counseling interventions delivered by trained nonspecialist providers, such as nurses and midwives, were effective in reducing perinatal depression and anxiety symptoms, highlighting task-sharing and telemedicine to expand mental health care access for pregnant and postpartum women. [ 115 ] [ 116 ] At these check ins mothers also have the opportunity to seek consultation from a physician about starting the breastfeeding process. [ 109 ] Maternal health problems include complications from childbirth that do not result in death. For every woman that dies during childbirth, approximately 20 develop infection , injury , or disability . [ 117 ] Around 75% of women who die in childbirth would be alive today if they had access to pregnancy prevention and healthcare interventions. [ 118 ] Black women are more likely to experience pregnancy-related deaths as well as to receive less effective medical care during pregnancy. [ 119 ] Women who have chronic hypertension before their pregnancy are at increased risk of complications such as premature birth , low birthweight or stillbirth . [ 120 ] Women who have high blood pressure and had complications in their pregnancy have three times the risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to women with normal blood pressure who had no complications in pregnancy. Monitoring pregnant women's blood pressure can help prevent both complications and future cardiovascular diseases. [ 121 ] [ 122 ] Almost 50% of the births in developing countries still take place without a medically skilled attendant to aid the mother, and the ratio is even higher in South Asia. [ 123 ] Women in Sub-Saharan Africa mainly rely on traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who have little or no formal health care training. In recognition of their role, some countries and non-governmental organizations are making efforts to train TBAs in maternal health topics, in order to improve the chances for better health outcomes among mothers and babies. [ 124 ] Breastfeeding provides women with several long-term benefits. Women who breastfeed experience better glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and blood pressure, and lose pregnancy weight faster than those who do not. Additionally, women who breastfeed experience lower rates of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and type 2 diabetes. [ 103 ] However, it is important to keep in mind that breastfeeding provides substantial benefits to women who are not infected with HIV. In countries where HIV/AIDS rates are high, such as South Africa and Kenya, the virus is a leading cause of maternal mortality, especially in mothers who breastfeed. [ 99 ] A complication is that many HIV-infected mothers cannot afford formula, and thus have no way of preventing transmission to the child through breast milk or avoiding health risks for themselves. [ 102 ] In cases like this, mothers have no choice but to breastfeed their infants regardless of their knowledge of the harmful effects. Worldwide, the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) , which is defined as deaths per 100,000 live births per time-period, has decreased, with South-East Asia seeing the most dramatic decrease of 59% and Africa seeing a decline of 27%. There are no regions that are on track to meet the Millennium Development Goal of decreasing maternal mortality by 75% by the year 2015. [ 126 ] [ 127 ] In a September 2016 ACOG/SMFM consensus, published concurrently in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology and by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), they noted that while they did not yet have a ""single, comprehensive definition of severe maternal morbidity"" (SMM), the rate of SMM is increasing in the United States as is maternal mortality. Both are ""associated with a high rate of preventability."" [ 10 ] [ 128 ] The U.S. Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations calls maternal mortality a "" sentinel event "", and uses it to assess the quality of a health care system. [ 11 ] Maternal mortality data is said to be an important indicator of overall health system quality because pregnant women survive in sanitary, safe, well-staffed and stocked facilities. If new mothers are thriving, it indicates that the health care system is doing its job. If not, problems likely exist. [ 129 ] According to Garret, increasing maternal survival, along with life expectancy, is an important goal for the world health community, as they show that other health issues are also improving. If these areas improve, disease-specific improvements are also better able to positively impact populations. [ 130 ] Maternal mortality rates are extremely high worldwide. However, most women who die during or after pregnancy live in low and lower-middle income countries. Specifically, in 2017, 94% of all maternal deaths occurred in low and lower-middle income countries. The MMR in low-income countries was 462 in 2017 signifying that 462 mothers died during childbirth for every 100,000 live births. [ 131 ] In many low and lower-middle income countries complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death among women of reproductive age. According to the World Health Organization, in its World Health Report 2005, poor maternal conditions account for the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide, after HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. [ 132 ] In low-income countries, most maternal deaths and injuries during pregnancy and labor are due to preventative issues that have been largely eradicated in higher income countries including postpartum hemorrhaging, hypertensive disease, and maternal infections. [ 133 ] For example, postpartum hemorrhaging is the leading cause of maternal death globally; however, 99% of postpartum hemorrhages occur in low and lower-middle income countries. [ 134 ] The MMR is extremely high in low-income countries; however, it is necessary to acknowledge the reduction in MMR that has occurred over the past two decades. The MMR has drastically declined in low-income countries since 2010. [ citation needed ] In low and lower-middle income countries, the average decline rate of the MMR is about 2.9% since 2000. [ citation needed ] This improvement was caused by lower pregnancy rates in some countries; higher income, which improves nutrition and access to health care; more education for women; and the increasing availability of ""skilled birth attendants""—people with training in basic and emergency obstetric care—to help women give birth. Despite this immense progress, there is still lots of work that must be done in order for low-income countries to meet the goal of the WHO organization of an MMR of less than 130 by 2030. Looking forward, the MMR in low and lower-income countries must continue to decline through improving access to skilled birth attendants to perform cesarean sections and other necessary procedures, increased access to family planning, and increased access to hospital facilities. [ 133 ] Until the early 20th century developed and developing countries had similar rates of maternal mortality. [ 135 ] Since most maternal deaths and injuries are preventable, [ 10 ] they have been largely eradicated in the developed world. In developed countries, Black (non-Latina) women have higher maternal mortality rates than White (non-Latina) women. According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene - Bureau of Maternal, Infant and Reproductive Health , it was found that from 2008 to 2012, Black (non-Latina) women have a pregnancy-related mortality rate twelve times higher than White (non-Latina) women. [ 136 ] The U.S. has the ""highest rate of maternal mortality in the industrialized world."" [ 137 ] It is also estimated that 50% of the deaths are from preventable causes. [ 138 ] It was found that Black women were experiencing higher rates of maternal mortality from cardiomyopathy, complications from hypertension, and hemorrhage. [ 139 ] Black women were also found to be at an increased risk for experiencing preeclampsia, abrupt placentae, placenta prevue, and postpartum hemorrhage when compared to white women. [ 139 ] Even though these obstetric complications could also occur in white women, black women were more likely to experience fatality and adverse outcomes from these complications. Since 2016, ProPublica and NPR investigated factors that led to the increase in maternal mortality in the United States. They reported that the ""rate of life-threatening complications for new mothers in the U.S. has more than doubled in two decades due to pre-existing conditions, medical errors and unequal access to care."" [ 137 ] According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), c. 4 million women who give birth in the US annually, over 50,000 a year, experience ""dangerous and even life-threatening complications."" [ 137 ] Of those 700 to 900 die every year ""related to pregnancy and childbirth."" A ""pervasive problem"" is the rapidly increasing rate of ""severe maternal morbidity"" (SMM), which does not yet have a ""single, comprehensive definition"". [ 10 ] The U.S healthcare system is in need of great improvement to reduce the rates of maternal mortality. With the shortage of primary care providers, including access to midwives and obstetricians, pregnant women are experiencing a delay in receiving prenatal care. [ 140 ] This is of even greater concern for pregnant women that have chronic conditions prior to pregnancy, such as hypertension or diabetes, that need to have their pregnancies closely monitored. [ 140 ] According to a report by the CDC, in 1993 the rate of SMM rose from 49.5 to 144 ""per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations"" in 2014, an increase of almost 200 percent. Blood transfusions also increased during the same period with ""from 24.5 in 1993 to 122.3 in 2014 and are considered to be the major driver of the increase in SMM. After excluding blood transfusions, the rate of SMM increased by about 20% over time, from 28.6 in 1993 to 35.0 in 2014."" [ 141 ] In SDG 3 , countries set a target to accelerate the decline of maternal mortality by 2030, specifically to: reduce ""the global MMR to less than 70 per 100 000 births, with no country having a maternal mortality rate of more than twice the global average"". The WHO estimates that the cost to provide basic family planning for both maternal and neonatal health care to women in developing countries is US$8 per person a year. [ 142 ] Many non-profit organizations have programs educating the public and gaining access to emergency obstetric care for mothers in developing countries. The United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) recently began its Campaign on Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa (CARMMA), focusing on providing quality healthcare to mothers. One of the programs within CARMMA is Sierra Leone providing free healthcare to mothers and children. This initiative has widespread support from African leaders and was started in conjunction with the African Union Health Ministers. [ 143 ] Improving maternal health was the fifth of the United Nations' eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), targeting a reduction in the number of women dying during pregnancy and childbirth by three quarters by 2015, notably by increasing the usage of skilled birth attendants, contraception and family planning. [ 144 ] The current decline of maternal deaths is only half of what is necessary to achieve this goal, and in several regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa the maternal mortality rate is actually increasing. However, one country that may meet their MDG 5 is Nepal, which has it appears reduced its maternal mortality by more than 50% since the early 1990s. [ 145 ] As the 2015 deadline for the MDG's approaches, an understanding of the policy developments leading to the inclusion of maternal health within the MDG's is essential for future advocacy efforts. [ 146 ] [ needs update ] According to the UNFPA , maternal deaths would be reduced by about two-thirds, from 287,000 to 105,000, if needs for modern family planning and maternal and new-born health care were met. [ 15 ] Therefore, investing in family planning and improved maternal health care brings many benefits including reduced risks of complications and improvement in health for mothers and their children. Education is also critical with research showing ""that women with no education were nearly three times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than women who had finished secondary school."" [ 15 ] Evidence shows that women who are better educated tend to have healthier children. Education would also improve employment opportunities for women which results in improving their status, contributing to family savings, reducing poverty and contributing to economic growth. All of these invests bring significant benefits and effects not only for women and girls but also their children, families, communities and their country. Developed countries had rates of maternal mortality similar to those of developing countries until the early twentieth century, therefore several lessons can be learned from the west. During the nineteenth century Sweden had high levels of maternal mortality, and there was a strong support within the country to reduce mortality rate to fewer than 300 per 100,000 live births. The Swedish government began public health initiatives to train enough midwives to attend all births. This approach was also later used by Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands who also experienced similar successes. [ 135 ] Increasing contraceptive usage and family planning also improves maternal health through reduction in numbers of higher risk pregnancies and by lowering the inter-pregnancy interval . [ 147 ] [ 148 ] [ 149 ] In Nepal a strong emphasis was placed on providing family planning to rural regions and it was shown to be effective. [ 150 ] Madagascar saw a dramatic increase in contraceptive use after instituting a nationwide family planning program, the rate of contraceptive use increased from 5.1% in 1992 to 29% in 2008. [ 151 ] Family planning has been reported to be a significant factor in maternal health. Governments should invest in their national healthcare to ensure that all women are aware of birth control methods. The government, through the ministry of health, should liaise with the private healthcare as well as the public healthcare division to ensure that women are educated and encouraged to use the right family planning method. The government should invest in this operation as when the rate of underage, as well as unplanned pregnancies, are reduced the healthcare cost stand a chance to drop by up to 8%. Healthcare will, therefore, be in a position to handle the other women who give birth. This will result in an improvement in maternal health. [ 152 ] Four elements are essential to maternal death prevention. [ according to whom? ] First, prenatal care. It is recommended [ by whom? ] that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and fetus. Second, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Third, emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are hemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labour. Lastly, postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery. During this time bleeding, sepsis and hypertensive disorders can occur and new-borns are extremely vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of birth. Therefore, follow-up visits by a health worker is assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended. [ 153 ] Digital health technologies are increasingly being used to support maternal care worldwide. Online pregnancy communities and telehealth programs have been shown to improve access to information and reduce feelings of isolation among expectant mothers. These digital tools can also help healthcare providers monitor pregnancies remotely, improving continuity of care for women in underserved or rural regions. According to the World Health Organization, “Digital health, or the use of digital technologies for health, has become a salient field of practice for employing routine and innovative forms of information and communications technology (ICT) to address health needs.” [ 154 ] A 2023 review found that digital technology-enabled health interventions, such as mobile applications and virtual education programs, improve engagement and health outcomes for expectant mothers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering,"Orienteering is a group of sports in which participants use a map and compass to navigate from point to point in unfamiliar terrain as quickly as possible. The sport originated from military land-navigation training in the late 19th century. It has since evolved into several competitive forms where participants race against the clock while navigating through checkpoints. Variants include automobile , underwater , mountain bike , ski , and trail orienteering . The most common form is foot orienteering , also known as FootO . In formal foot-orienteering competitions, participants are given a specially prepared orienteering map , usually topographical, which they use to locate control points . [ 4 ] Orienteering is part of the World Games [ 5 ] and the World Police and Fire Games . [ 6 ] Orienteering originated in Sweden in the late 19th century. The term orientering (Swedish for “orientation”) was first used in 1886 at the Military Academy Karlberg , describing navigation across unfamiliar terrain using a map and compass. [ 1 ] The activity developed from military land navigation exercises into a civilian sport. The first civilian competition open to the public was held in Norway in 1897, when the country was part of the Union between Sweden and Norway . [ 1 ] In 1901, the first Swedish public event included control points at historic sites such as Spånga Church and Bromma Church , a round church . [ 7 ] Affordable compasses helped the sport expand during the 1930s. By 1934, about 250,000 Swedes participated, and orienteering had spread to Finland , Switzerland , the Soviet Union , and Hungary . After World War II , it spread across Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania. In 1959, Sweden hosted an international conference with delegates from 12 countries, leading to the formation of the International Orienteering Federation (IOF) in 1961. [ 1 ] By 2010, the IOF included 71 member federations worldwide. [ 8 ] World Championships were held biennially until 2003 and annually thereafter. [ 9 ] Orienteering remains most popular in Scandinavia , home to long-running events such as the Jukola relay and Tiomila , both established in the 1940s. The O-Ringen , held annually since 1965, attracts around 15,000 competitors. [ 10 ] The sport was originally practiced in forest terrain but later expanded to fell , heathland , and moorland areas. Urban and park orienteering became established in the 1990s and 2000s through events such as the Park World Tour , supported by dedicated urban map standards (ISSOM) and electronic timing systems. [ 11 ] These formats are now included in national and international ranking systems. [ 12 ] Orienteering sports combine significant navigation with a specific method of travel. Because the method of travel determines the needed equipment and tactics, each sport requires specific rules for competition and guidelines for orienteering event logistics and course design. International Orienteering Federation , the governing body of the sport, currently sanctions the following four disciplines as official disciplines in the sport of orienteering: Moreover, International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) sanctions the following orienteering sport: Other orienteering disciplines include, but are not limited to: Adventure racing is a combination of two or more disciplines, and usually includes orienteering as part of the race . At international level, the International Orienteering Federation (IOF) [ 17 ] defines rules and guidelines [ 18 ] which govern four orienteering sports: foot orienteering , mountain bike orienteering , ski orienteering , and trail orienteering . [ 19 ] It is based in Sweden [ 20 ] and it claims on its website to aim to ""spread the sport of orienteering, to promote its development and to create and maintain an attractive world event programme."" [ 21 ] Since 1977 the IOF has been recognised by the IOC . [ 22 ] There are governing bodies for most of the individual nations that are represented in the sport of orienteering. These national bodies are the rule-making body for that nation. For example, the British Orienteering Federation is the national governing body for the United Kingdom . The federation was founded in 1967 and it is made up of 13 constituent associations. [ 23 ] For the United States , the national governing body is Orienteering USA . Most nations have some form of regional governing bodies. These are not rule-making bodies but are there to assist in coordinating clubs within that region, e.g., they may allocate dates so that clubs do not clash with their events. Clubs are usually formed at a local level and affiliated to their national governing body. It is clubs who put on events usually open to all-comers. Clubs may also put on practice, training, and social events. Open clubs are open to anyone and there is usually no restriction on joining them. Closed clubs restrict their membership to specific groups. For example, BAOC (British Army Orienteering Club) [ 24 ] has restrictions on who may join, principally British Army personnel. The competition, or race, is intended to test the navigational skill, concentration, and running ability of the competitors. High levels of fitness and running speed are required to compete successfully at an international or elite level. To ensure fairness between competitors the map is not usually provided until the start, and starts are normally staggered with competitors starting at not less than one-minute intervals. [ 27 ] The objective on each leg is to follow the fastest route between controls. The fastest is not always the shortest route, and can depend heavily on route choice . [ 28 ] Orienteering competitions use specially prepared orienteering maps . They are topographic maps although much more detailed than general-purpose maps. The ISOM map scales are 1:15,000, 1:10,000, or 1:7,500, with grids aligned to magnetic north . Map symbols are standardized by the IOF, [ 29 ] and designed to be readable by any competitor regardless of background or native tongue. Orienteering events offer a range of courses, of varying physical and technical difficulty, to meet the needs of competitors. The orienteering course is marked in purple or red on a map. [ 30 ] A triangle is used to indicate the start and a double circle indicates the finish. Circles are used to show the control points. [ 31 ] At international, national, and the larger events, courses are classified by age, e.g., M35 for men 35 years of age and older. Classes requiring similar distances and difficulties are usually combined into a smaller number of courses, e.g., M60 will normally share a course with W50, and often with M65 and W55. The results are normally arranged by class. [ 32 ] In the smaller events courses are provided by ability. The United States [ 31 ] [ 33 ] and the United Kingdom use colour coding to define the difficulty of the courses. Short, easy courses are provided for beginners and younger competitors, with technically and physically demanding courses being provided for experienced orienteers. Ranging from easy and short to long and technical, there are; White, Yellow, Orange, Light Green, Green, Blue and Brown. [ 34 ] Some orienteering clubs have set up permanent courses, which can be used for personal, or club, training. Non-standard permanent markers are used as control kites, and maps of the courses are usually available publicly for a fee. [ 35 ] The courses are usually set up in public areas and there may be some restrictions on access, e.g., daylight hours only. Clubs also organise informal events for practice and training. [ 36 ] Control points are placed on features on the map that can be clearly identified on the ground. Control points are marked in the terrain by white and orange ""flags"". Competitors receive a ""control description sheet"" or ""clue sheet"" which gives a precise description of the feature and the location of the kite, e.g., boulder, 5m, north side. For experienced orienteers the descriptions use symbols (pictorial), in accordance with the IOF Control descriptions . [ 37 ] Each competitor is required to carry an electronic or paper control card, and to present it at the Start and hand it in at the Finish. The control card is marked by some means at each control point to show that the competitor has completed the course correctly. Most events now use electronic punching, although cards and needle punches are still widely used. [ 38 ] The winner is normally the competitor with the fastest time, but other scoring systems can be used, e.g., score events and Trail-O. Most events produce provisional results 'on the day', with draft results on the Internet that night; the final results being confirmed a few days later. With electronic punching [ 39 ] the results can include split times for competitors. These show the times between controls and aggregate times to each control. With suitable computer software these times can be displayed in a graphical form (Progressograph). [ 40 ] Each competitor is responsible for his or her own safety. There are no rules, but there are guidelines, which should be followed. The basic safety check was the stub check . The competitor hands in his stub at the start and his control card at the finish. Event officials match the two and any unmatched stubs represent a missing competitor. This has been superseded with electronic punching in that event officials can now request a 'still to finish' report listing all those competitors who punched at the start but have not yet downloaded their electronic card. All competitors must report to the finish whether they have completed the course or not. [ 27 ] [ 31 ] IOF rule 21.1 is that the specification for clothing is delegated to the national organising body, and no specific clothing is required. [ 41 ] Unique among English speaking countries, Ireland and the UK require legs to be covered. Rule 7.1.1 requires full body cover : the torso and legs must be covered, [ 42 ] while organizer may allow shorts (e.g., in park or street orienteering). In the United States, rule A.34.1 states that competitors are free to choose clothing that they are most comfortable in (full leg cover is not required), unless specifically stated in the meet announcement. In Australia, under the 2021 rules, 2.1.21, the choice of clothing is also left up to the competitor, and full leg cover is not required. [ 43 ] In Canada, no specific clothing is required, but participants are encouraged to wear clothing suitable for the weather, and hiking or running shoes. Similarly in New Zealand, there are no rules in force limiting orienteers to running only in full leg cover. The early competitors used standard athletic clothing, i.e., shorts and an athletic vest, which provided little protection for racing through undergrowth . Purpose-made lightweight nylon full-body suits were later adopted. The early O-suits were made in muted colours but modern suits are generally multi-coloured. Clubs often organise the bulk purchase of clothing, which are then made in the club colours with the club's name prominently displayed. Some competitors prefer lycra tights or leggings. Gaiters are also often worn. Lightweight studded (and often cleated) orienteering shoes are commonly used. The basic equipment required for orienteering is usually listed as a compass and appropriate outdoor clothing. Most national bodies recommend that a whistle be carried for safety reasons. Competitive orienteers usually use specialized equipment: Orienteering events can be classified in many different aspects: [ 44 ] Classic orienteering involves a race between controls in a preset order. The winner is the person who completes the course in the shortest time. This is called a ""cross-country"" course as distinct from a score course (see below). Courses are normally designed so that the fastest route is not straightforward to find on the map, or to follow on the ground. The classic race has a typical winning time of 75–90 minutes. As of 2007, the IOF have dictated that the ""classic"" course should be redesignated the ""long"". The middle distance is a shorter cross-country race than the classic (or long), with a winning time in the region of 30 minutes and with an emphasis more on fine navigation than route-choice. When races of this distance were run in the mid-late 1990s, they were called ""short"" races, or ""sprint-O"". The short distance was introduced as a world championship discipline in 1991. More recently, though the IOF have renamed this distance as ""middle"". A relay race is run by a team of competitors each running a course, and the result is based on the team's total time. Relays usually employ a mass start instead of a staggered start. Relays are part of World Orienteering Championships both as sprint relays and as cross-country relays. Additionally, there are popular mass club races out of which Jukola relay has the highest number of participating clubs 1,787 (in 2015), while 25-manna has the highest number of legs 25. To reduce competitors following each other, various spreading methods might be used. This is called ""gaffling"", which is a Swedish word meaning ""forking"". The key principle is that every team must run every leg (between each pair of two controls), but not necessarily in the same order. The IOF have introduced the nomenclature to try to clarify the usage of the word ""leg"". In orienteering usage, leg normally refers to the part of a race between two control points. In relay (non-orienteering) usage, leg refers to the part of a race run by a single team member. The IOF prefer ""lap"" for this latter term, but despite this, in common parlance, ""leg"" is used for both terms. Competitors visit as many controls as possible within a time limit. There is usually a mass start (rather than staggered), with a time limit. Controls may have different point values depending on difficulty, and there is a point penalty for each minute late. The competitor with the most points is the winner. The large-scale, endurance-style version of a Score-O is known as a rogaine , competed by teams in events lasting (often) 24 hours. A very large area is used for competition, and the map scale is smaller. The format originated in Australia. The term ROGAINE is often said to stand for Rugged Outdoor Group Activity Involving Navigation and Endurance; this is essentially a backronym , as the name actually originates from the names of Rod, Gail and Neil Phillips, who were among Australian Rogaining's first participants. [ 45 ] Very short races, with winning times in the region of 12–15 minutes, often held in city parks and other more urban settings. Map scales are usually 1:5,000 or 1:4,000. Control sites can include benches, litterbins, sculptures, and other objects common to urban parks. [ 46 ] The sprint distance may also be held in the forest, when it would be called a ""forest sprint"" as opposed to an ""urban sprint"". This distance was pioneered in the late 1990s as an elite event by the Park World Tour organisation who organised an independent ""world cup"" in park sprint orienteering. In 2001 in Tampere, the IOF included a sprint distance in the orienteering world championships. Ultrasprint events are held in a specially constructed labyrinth. Due to the limited area of the labyrinth, ultrasprint is a more spectator-friendly form of orienteering. Also, as the course is artificial, identical courses can be set in different geographical locations for simultaneous local competitions as parts of a larger tournament. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Competitors use a headlamp to navigate in the dark. Reflective markers often are used on control point flags, which shifts the tactics from precision navigation to searching. Competitors can travel at high speed to the vicinity of the control point, then sweep the area with the light to catch a reflection off the control flag. If a night event starts before dark, a mass start must be used so all competitors have equal time in the light and dark. The two classic club relays, Tiomila and Jukola , both include night legs. [ 49 ] Full length (24-hour) rogaines and many adventure races run through the night, without a light period, and competitors may choose not to rest. Competitors follow a string around a short course, noting down things that they find on the way. This is generally used by young children and people new to the sport who want to find out what it is like. [ 50 ] Precision orienteering generally is not a speed event, but rather a test of the competitors' ability to precisely match map and terrain. Examples include trail-O (untimed), TREC style mounted orienteering , and Radio Orienteering in a Compact Area (ROCA). Both trail-O and ROCA use decoys in the vicinity of the control point. Efforts begun in 1996 to promote the inclusion of orienteering in the Olympic Games have so far been unsuccessful, although orienteering became a sport in the World Games in 2001, and is a sport in the Summer Deaflympics . Supporters recognize that the sport is neither television- nor spectator-friendly, the venue of competition is often necessarily remote from major cities, and the duration of the event is longer than most other individual competitions. [ 51 ] Efforts to develop a format suitable for Olympic competitions have focused on park orienteering, micro-orienteering, and short-distance relays. Sprint Orienteering on foot as a format of the sport is most likely to be included in Olympic Games, as this discipline is becoming more and more popular worldwide and can have a significant spectator interest. According to the website of a Chicago Orienteering club, ""the International Orienteering Federation is committed to entering the Olympic World."" [ 52 ] Although not an official demonstration sport , an international ski-orienteering event was held in Sugadaira Kōgen , Japan , as part of the International Cultural Festival held in conjunction with the XVIII Winter Olympic Games in Nagano in 1998. [ 53 ] The International Orienteering Federation petitioned the International Olympic Committee in 2002 to include ski orienteering in the 2006 Winter Olympic Games , noting that it could share the venue with the biathlon competitions. [ 54 ] In its formal recommendation that ski orienteering not be included in those games, the Olympic Programme Commission focused on a lack of participation in the sport outside Nordic countries , ""the challenges for broadcasters and spectators to easily follow the competition"", and the costs associated with new technology and a new results system. [ 55 ] In 2005, the International Olympic Committee confirmed that ski orienteering was under consideration for inclusion in the review process of the Olympic sport program for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games . [ 56 ] On 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include any new sports in this review process. [ 57 ] The World Orienteering Championships (WOC) is an annual event organised by the International Orienteering Federation . The first World Championships was held in Fiskars , Finland in 1966. They were held biennially up to 2003 (with the exception of 1978 and 1979). Since 2003, competitions have been held annually. The format of the World Orienteering Championships alternates every 2 years, with even years hosting sprint format events and odd years hosting forest format events. [ 58 ] As of 2019 [update] , when applying the Olympic-style gold first rankings method to medals won at the World Orienteering Championships, Europe has been dominant, with Sweden 's 171 medals won marking them as the most successful world championships nation. Orienteering has been a part of the World Games program since 2001. As Orienteering is a sport practiced primarily in Europe, the European Orienteering Championships is also an important event in the orienteering calendar. As of 2021, the European Championships is held in tandem with the World Championships, with the European Championships hosting the Sprint events when the World Championships hosts the Forest events and vice versa. The annual Orienteering World Cup is hosted over a number of events throughout the year, with winners of the overall world cup being awarded following the final event. The World University Orienteering Championships are hosted biannually. The Junior World Championships has been held every year since 1990. The European Youth Championships are the main international event for Junior orienteers below the age of 18. A multi-day event with open entry held in different locations in Sweden , O-Ringen is the largest multi-day orienteering event in the world. A night relay with open entry held in different locations in Finland , Jukola is the largest relay orienteering event in the world. Jukola is considered equal to Tiomila as the most prestigious event in club orienteering.

Finding the way around the outdoors is still very important. When people visit National Parks or other wild lands, they need to know where they are going on trails and paths. Over the years nature changes. Trees grow and fall over, wildfires occur, and floods take place. Therefore, signage and environmental markers need to change too. In one study, National Park staff asked 36 participants to think out loud while going through the park, reading the park map, and interpreting signage throughout the park. The researchers analyzed and reviewed the participants' comments to evaluate signage design and placement. This helped the staff understand how to improve signage so that hikers felt more at ease and oriented. Novice hikers, especially, may not understand non-textual hiking signs such as blazes, cairns, and ducks. [ 59 ] Other studies have focused on novice orienteers solving orienteering tasks. One involved eight hiking volunteers. Half did a recording and audio during the hike while half verbalized after the hike what they saw and experienced. Hikers described their orienteering activity and made suggestions on how to improve the teaching of orienteering and orienteering practices. [ 60 ] A central problem is map reading skills and understanding the imprecision of maps as a scaled down abstraction of an area at a single point in time. Hikers unused to orienteering often lack these skills and this understanding. Also, there are many kinds of maps, people need to be aware of the differences, what type of maps will work best for them, and particular issues such as scale and magnetic declination . [ 61 ] Semiotics is an important tool to improve one's understanding of maps and way-finding in the outdoors. Topography and symbols for water, trees, private vs. public land etc. are all important semiotic markers for reading maps, orienteering, and finding one's way around the wilderness. Map symbols need to be simple, understandable, and meet professional cartography standards. Carto semiotics helps make sense of symbols used in different types of maps such as globes , relief models , and animations . Carto semiotics also includes the study of map keys , legends, and units of measurement between destinations. [ 62 ]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimism,"Pessimism is a mental attitude in which an undesirable outcome is anticipated from a given situation. Pessimists tend to focus on the negatives of life in general. A common question asked to test for pessimism is "" Is the glass half empty or half full? ""; in this situation, a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty, or in extreme cases completely empty, while an optimist is said to see the glass as half full. Throughout history, the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking. [ 1 ] The term pessimism derives from the Latin word pessimus , meaning 'the worst'. It was first used by Jesuit critics of Voltaire 's 1759 novel Candide, ou l'Optimisme . Voltaire was satirizing the philosophy of Leibniz who maintained that this was the 'best (optimum) of all possible worlds'. In their attacks on Voltaire, the Jesuits of the Revue de Trévoux accused him of pessimisme . [ 2 ] : 9 In the ancient world , psychological pessimism was associated with melancholy , and was believed to be caused by an excess of black bile in the body. The study of pessimism has parallels with the study of depression . Psychologists trace pessimistic attitudes to emotional pain or even biology. Aaron Beck argues that depression is due to unrealistic negative views about the world. Beck starts treatment by engaging in conversation with clients about their unhelpful thoughts. Pessimists, however, are often able to provide arguments that suggest that their understanding of reality is justified; as in Depressive realism or ( pessimistic realism ). [ 1 ] Deflection is a common method used by those who are depressed. They let people assume they are revealing everything which proves to be an effective way of hiding. [ 3 ] The pessimism item on the Beck Depression Inventory has been judged useful in predicting suicides . [ 4 ] The Beck Hopelessness Scale has also been described as a measurement of pessimism. [ 5 ] Wender and Klein point out that pessimism can be useful in some circumstances: ""If one is subject to a series of defeats, it pays to adopt a conservative game plan of sitting back and waiting and letting others take the risks. Such waiting would be fostered by a pessimistic outlook. Similarly if one is raking in the chips of life, it pays to adopt an expansive risk-taking approach, and thus maximize access to scarce resources."" [ 6 ] The leading causes of pessimism are genetics , past experience, and social and environmental factors. One study of 5,187 teenage twins and their siblings suggests that genetics may account for one-third of the variance in whether someone leans toward pessimism vs. optimism , with the remaining variance due to their environment, and twin studies suggest that, when it comes to personality, about half the differences between us are because of genetic factors. But Spector points out that throughout our lives, in response to environmental factors, our genes are constantly being dialled up and down as with a dimmer switch, a process known as epigenetics . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Through history, some have concluded that a pessimistic attitude, although justified, must be avoided to endure. Optimistic attitudes are favored and of emotional consideration. [ 9 ] Al-Ghazali and William James rejected their pessimism after suffering psychological , or even psychosomatic illness. Criticisms of this sort however assume that pessimism leads inevitably to a mood of darkness and utter depression. Many philosophers would disagree, claiming that the term ""pessimism"" is being abused. The link between pessimism and nihilism is present, but the former does not necessarily lead to the latter, as philosophers such as Albert Camus believed. Happiness is not inextricably linked to optimism , nor is pessimism inextricably linked to unhappiness. One could easily imagine an unhappy optimist, and a happy pessimist. Accusations of pessimism may be used to silence legitimate criticism. Nouriel Roubini , an economist who introduces himself as Dr. Doom, was largely dismissed as a pessimist in 2006 for his dire but to some extent accurate predictions of a financial crisis , ahead of the 2008 financial crisis . However, financial journalist Justin Fox observed in the Harvard Business Review in 2010 that the crisis Roubini predicted was not at all like the 2008 financial crisis ; it involved a currency crisis and run on the dollar and dismissed Roubini's predictions as inaccurate. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Others noted that ""The problem is that even though he was spectacularly right on this one, he went on to predict time and time again, as the markets and the economy recovered in the years following the collapse, that there would be a follow-up crisis and that more extreme crashes were inevitable. His calls, after his initial pronouncement, were consistently wrong. Indeed, if you had listened to him, and many investors did, you would have missed the longest bull market run in US market history."" [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Another observed: ""For a prophet, he's wrong an awful lot of the time."" [ 17 ] Tony Robbins wrote: ""Roubini warned of a recession in 2004 (wrongly), 2005 (wrongly), 2006 (wrongly), and 2007 (wrongly)"" ... and he ""predicted (wrongly) that there'd be a 'significant' stock market correction in 2013."" [ 18 ] Speaking about Roubini, economist Anirvan Banerji told The New York Times : ""Even a stopped clock is right twice a day."" [ 19 ] Economist Nariman Behravesh said: ""Nouriel Roubini has been singing the doom-and-gloom story for 10 years. Eventually something was going to be right."" [ 20 ] Personality Plus opines that pessimistic temperaments ( e.g. , melancholy and phlegmatic ) can be useful inasmuch as pessimists' focus on the negative helps them spot problems that people with more optimistic temperaments ( e.g. , choleric and sanguine ) miss. [ citation needed ] Philosophical pessimism is not a state of mind or a psychological disposition, but rather it is a worldview or philosophical position that assigns a negative value to life or existence. Philosophical pessimists commonly argue that the world contains an empirical prevalence of pains over pleasures, that existence is ontologically or metaphysically adverse to living beings, and that life is fundamentally meaningless or without purpose . [ 21 ] Philosophical pessimism stands opposed to the optimism or even utopianism of Hegelian philosophies. Emil Cioran claimed ""Hegel is chiefly responsible for modern optimism. How could he have failed to see that consciousness changes only its forms and modalities, but never progresses?"" [ 22 ] Philosophical pessimism is differentiated from other political philosophies by having no ideal governmental structure or political project, rather pessimism generally tends to be an anti- systematic philosophy of individual action. [ 2 ] : 7 This is because philosophical pessimists tend to be skeptical that any politics of social progress can actually improve the human condition. As Cioran states, ""every step forward is followed by a step back: this is the unfruitful oscillation of history"". [ 23 ] Cioran also attacks political optimism because it creates an ""idolatry of tomorrow"" which can be used to authorize anything in its name. This does not mean however, that the pessimist cannot be politically involved, as Camus argued in The Rebel (1951). Pessimism about the human condition was also expressed by Hobbes (1588–1679). [ 24 ] [ 25 ] There is another strain of thought generally associated with a pessimistic worldview, this is the pessimism of cultural criticism and social decline . Anthony Trollope summarised the attitude with gentle mockery in 1880: ""Everything is going wrong. [...] Farmers are generally on the verge of ruin. Trade is always bad. The Church is in danger. The House of Lords isn't worth a dozen years' purchase. The throne totters."" [ 26 ] Oswald Spengler 's The Decline of the West (1918–1922) popularised pessimism. Spengler promoted a cyclic model of history similar to the theories of Giambattista Vico (1668–1744). Spengler believed that modern western civilization was in a ""winter"" age of decline ( German : Untergang ). Spenglerian theory was immensely influential in interwar Europe, especially in Weimar Germany . Similarly, traditionalist Julius Evola (1898–1974) thought that the world was in the Kali Yuga , a Dark Age of moral decline. Intellectuals such as Oliver James correlate economic progress with economic inequality , the stimulation of artificial needs, and affluenza . Anti-consumerists identify rising trends of conspicuous consumption and self-interested, image-conscious behavior in culture. Post-modernists like Jean Baudrillard (1929–2007) have even argued that culture (and therefore our lives) now has no basis in reality whatsoever. [ 1 ] Conservative thinkers, especially social conservatives , often perceive politics in a generally pessimistic way. William F. Buckley famously remarked that he was ""standing athwart history yelling 'stop! ' "", and Whittaker Chambers (1901-1961) was convinced that capitalism was bound to fall to communism , though he himself became staunchly anti-communist . Social conservatives often see the West as a decadent and nihilistic civilization which has abandoned its roots in Christianity and/or Greek philosophy, leaving it doomed to fall into moral and political decay. Robert Bork 's Slouching Toward Gomorrah and Allan Bloom 's The Closing of the American Mind are famous expressions of this point of view. Many economic conservatives and libertarians believe that the expansion of the state and the role of government in society is inevitable, and that they are at best fighting a holding action against it. [ citation needed ] [ 27 ] They hold that the natural tendency of people is to be ruled and that freedom is an exceptional state of affairs which is now being abandoned in favor of social and economic security provided by the welfare state . [ citation needed ] Political pessimism has sometimes found expression in dystopian novels such as George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four . [ 28 ] Political pessimism about one's country often correlates with a desire to emigrate . [ 29 ] During the 2008 financial crisis in the United States, the neologism "" pessimism porn "" came to describe the alleged eschatological and survivalist thrill some people derive from predicting, reading, and fantasizing about the collapse of civil society through the destruction of the world's economic system. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Puolanka , a municipality located in the Kainuu region in the northern Finland , has been called the ""most pessimistic municipality in Finland"", [ 34 ] and in 2019, the municipality gained worldwide publicity when the BBC published a video about Puolanka, describing it as the ""most pessimistic town in the world"". [ 35 ] Pessimism has a long tradition in the Kainuu region, mostly because Kainuu was a poor region that had often suffered from famines in the late 19th century and early 20th century, which is why the region is also called a ""hunger land"". [ 36 ] Technological pessimism is the belief that advances in science and technology do not lead to an improvement in the human condition. Technological pessimism can be said to have originated during the Industrial Revolution with the Luddite movement. Luddites blamed the rise of industrial mills and advanced factory machinery for the loss of their jobs and set out to destroy them. The Romantic movement was also pessimistic towards the rise of technology and longed for simpler and more natural times. Poets like William Wordsworth and William Blake believed that industrialization was polluting the purity of nature. [ 37 ] Some social critics and environmentalists believe that globalization , overpopulation and the economic practices of modern capitalist states over-stress the planet's ecological equilibrium . They warn that unless something is done to slow this, climate change will worsen eventually leading to some form of social and ecological collapse . [ 38 ] James Lovelock believes that the ecology of the Earth has already been irretrievably damaged, and even an unrealistic shift in politics would not be enough to save it. According to Lovelock, the Earth's climate regulation system is being overwhelmed by pollution and the Earth will soon jump from its current state into a dramatically hotter climate. [ 39 ] Lovelock blames this state of affairs on what he calls ""polyanthroponemia"", which is when: ""humans overpopulate until they do more harm than good."" Lovelock states: The presence of 7 billion people aiming for first-world comforts…is clearly incompatible with the homeostasis of climate but also with chemistry, biological diversity and the economy of the system. [ 39 ] Some radical environmentalists , anti-globalization activists, and Neo-luddites can be said to hold to this type of pessimism about the effects of modern ""progress"". A more radical form of environmental pessimism is anarcho-primitivism which faults the agricultural revolution with giving rise to social stratification, coercion, and alienation. Some anarcho-primitivists promote deindustrialization , abandonment of modern technology and rewilding . An infamous anarcho-primitivist is Theodore Kaczynski , also known as the Unabomber, who engaged in a nationwide mail bombing campaign. In his 1995 Unabomber Manifesto , he called attention to the erosion of human freedom by the rise of the modern ""industrial-technological system"". [ 40 ] The manifesto begins thus: The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ""advanced"" countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ""advanced"" countries. One of the most radical pessimist organizations is the voluntary human extinction movement , which argues for the extinction of the human race through antinatalism . Pope Francis ' controversial 2015 encyclical on ecological issues is rife with pessimistic assessments of the role of technology in the modern world . [ citation needed ] ""Entropy pessimism"" represents a special case of technological and environmental pessimism, based on thermodynamic principles . [ 41 ] : 116 According to the first law of thermodynamics , matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy. According to the second law of thermodynamics —also known as the entropy law—what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources ) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution ). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary ""heat death"" of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment—a state of maximum entropy locally on earth; ""locally"" on earth, that is, when compared to the heat death of the universe , taken as a whole. The term ""entropy pessimism"" was coined to describe the work of Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen , a progenitor in economics and the paradigm founder of ecological economics . [ 41 ] : 116 Georgescu-Roegen made extensive use of the entropy concept in his magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process . [ 42 ] Since the 1990s, leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly —a student of Georgescu-Roegen—had been the economic profession's most influential proponent of entropy pessimism prior to his death in 2022. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] : 545 Among other matters, the entropy pessimism position is concerned with the existential impossibility of allocating Earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way—or only little way—of knowing in advance if or when humankind will ultimately face extinction . In effect, any conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point. [ 45 ] : 369–371 [ 46 ] : 253–256 [ 47 ] : 165 [ 48 ] : 168–171 [ 49 ] : 150–153 [ 50 ] : 106–109 [ 44 ] : 546–549 [ 51 ] : 142–145 Entropy pessimism is a widespread view in ecological economics and in the degrowth movement . Bibas writes that some criminal defense attorneys prefer to err on the side of pessimism: ""Optimistic forecasts risk being proven disastrously wrong at trial, an embarrassing result that makes clients angry. On the other hand, if clients plead based on their lawyers' overly pessimistic advice, the cases do not go to trial and the clients are none the wiser."" [ 52 ]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene,"The Holocene ( / ˈ h ɒ l . ə s iː n , - oʊ -, ˈ h oʊ . l ə -, - l oʊ -/ ) [ 3 ] [ 4 ] is the current geological epoch , beginning approximately 11,700 years ago. [ 5 ] It follows the Last Glacial Period , which concluded with the Holocene glacial retreat . [ 5 ] The Holocene and the preceding Pleistocene [ 6 ] together form the Quaternary period. The Holocene is an interglacial period within the ongoing glacial cycles of the Quaternary, and is equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage 1 . The name ""Holocene"" comes from Ancient Greek ὅλος ( hólos ), meaning ""whole"", and καινός ( kainós ), meaning ""new, recent"", referring that this epoch is ""entirely new"". The Holocene correlates with the last maximum axial tilt towards the Sun of the Earth's obliquity . The Holocene corresponds with the rapid proliferation, growth, and impacts of the human species worldwide, hence the Holocene is often commonly referred to as the Age of Humans , including all of its written history , technological revolutions , development of major civilizations , and overall significant transition towards urban living in the present. The human impact on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for the future evolution of living species, including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence, or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of the human impact. Following the extinction of most large terrestrial mammals outside of Africa during the preceding Late Pleistocene , the ecosystems of the Holocene continued to be impacted by extinctions (the ongoing Holocene extinction ), largely of human causation. In July 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene Epoch into three distinct ages based on the climate, Greenlandian (11,700 years ago to 8,200 years ago), Northgrippian (8,200 years ago to 4,200 years ago) and Meghalayan (4,200 years ago to the present), as proposed by the International Commission on Stratigraphy . [ 7 ] The oldest age, the Greenlandian, was characterized by a warming following the preceding ice age. The Northgrippian Age is known for vast cooling due to a disruption in ocean circulations that was caused by the melting of glaciers. The most recent age of the Holocene is the present Meghalayan, which began with extreme drought that lasted around 200 years. [ 7 ] The word ""Holocene"" comes from Ancient Greek ὅλος ( hólos ), meaning ""whole"", and καινός ( kainós ), meaning ""new, recent"", referring that this epoch is ""entirely new"". [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The suffix '-cene' is used for all the seven epochs of the Cenozoic Era. The International Commission on Stratigraphy has defined the Holocene as starting approximately 11,700 years before 2000 CE (11,650 cal years BP , or 9,700 BCE). [ 5 ] The Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) regards the term 'recent' as an incorrect way of referring to the Holocene, preferring the term 'modern' instead to describe current processes. It also observes that the term 'Flandrian' may be used as a synonym for Holocene, although it is becoming outdated. [ 11 ] The International Commission on Stratigraphy, however, considers the Holocene to be an epoch following the Pleistocene and specifically following the last glacial period . Local names for the last glacial period include the Wisconsinan in North America , [ 12 ] the Weichselian in Europe, [ 13 ] the Devensian in Britain, [ 14 ] the Llanquihue in Chile [ 15 ] and the Otiran in New Zealand. [ 16 ] The Holocene can be subdivided into five time intervals, or chronozones , based on climatic fluctuations: [ 17 ] [ needs update? ] Geologists working in different regions are studying sea levels, peat bogs, and ice-core samples, using a variety of methods, with a view toward further verifying and refining the Blytt–Sernander sequence . This is a classification of climatic periods initially defined by plant remains in peat mosses . [ 18 ] Though the method was once thought to be of little interest, based on 14 C dating of peats that was inconsistent with the claimed chronozones, [ 19 ] investigators have found a general correspondence across Eurasia and North America . The scheme was defined for Northern Europe , but the climate changes were claimed to occur more widely. The periods of the scheme include a few of the final pre-Holocene oscillations of the last glacial period and then classify climates of more recent prehistory . [ 20 ] Paleontologists have not defined any faunal stages for the Holocene. If subdivision is necessary, periods of human technological development, such as the Mesolithic , Neolithic , and Bronze Age , are usually used. However, the time periods referenced by these terms vary with the emergence of those technologies in different parts of the world. [ 21 ] Some scholars have argued that a third epoch of the Quaternary, the Anthropocene , has now begun. [ 22 ] This term has been used to denote the present time-interval in which many geologically significant conditions and processes have been profoundly altered by human activities. The 'Anthropocene' (a term coined by Paul J. Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer in 2000) was never a formally defined geological unit. The Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) had a working group to determine whether it should be. In May 2019, members of the working group voted in favour of recognizing the Anthropocene as formal chrono-stratigraphic unit, with stratigraphic signals around the mid-twentieth century CE as its base. The exact criteria were still to be determined, after which the recommendation also had to be approved by the working group's parent bodies (ultimately the International Union of Geological Sciences ). [ 23 ] In March 2024, after 15 years of deliberation, the Anthropocene Epoch proposal of the working group was voted down by a wide margin by the SQS, owing largely to its shallow sedimentary record and extremely recent proposed start date. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The ICS and the International Union of Geological Sciences later formally confirmed, by a near unanimous vote, the rejection of the working group's Anthropocene Epoch proposal for inclusion in the Geologic Time Scale. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The Holocene is a geologic epoch that follows directly after the Pleistocene. Continental motions due to plate tectonics are less than a kilometre over a span of only 10,000 years. However, ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 m (115 ft) in the early part of the Holocene and another 30 m in the later part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 m (590 ft) due to post-glacial rebound over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today. [ 29 ] The sea-level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. For example, marine fossils from the Holocene epoch have been found in locations such as Vermont and Michigan . Other than higher-latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain , and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely tectonic uplift of non-glacial origin. [ citation needed ] Post-glacial rebound in the Scandinavia region resulted in a shrinking Baltic Sea . The region continues to rise, still causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe. An equivalent event in North America was the rebound of Hudson Bay , as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial Tyrrell Sea phase, to its present boundaries. [ 30 ] The climate throughout the Holocene has shown significant variability despite ice core records from Greenland suggesting a more stable climate following the preceding ice age. Marine chemical fluxes during the Holocene were lower than during the Younger Dryas, but were still considerable enough to imply notable changes in the climate. The temporal and spatial extent of climate change during the Holocene is an area of considerable uncertainty, with radiative forcing recently proposed to be the origin of cycles identified in the North Atlantic region. Climate cyclicity through the Holocene ( Bond events ) has been observed in or near marine settings and is strongly controlled by glacial input to the North Atlantic. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Periodicities of ≈2500, ≈1500, and ≈1000 years are generally observed in the North Atlantic. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] At the same time spectral analyses of the continental record, which is remote from oceanic influence, reveal persistent periodicities of 1,000 and 500 years that may correspond to solar activity variations during the Holocene Epoch. [ 36 ] A 1,500-year cycle corresponding to the North Atlantic oceanic circulation may have had widespread global distribution in the Late Holocene. [ 36 ] From 8,500 BP to 6,700 BP, North Atlantic climate oscillations were highly irregular and erratic because of perturbations from substantial ice discharge into the ocean from the collapsing Laurentide Ice Sheet. [ 37 ] The Greenland ice core records indicate that climate changes became more regional and had a larger effect on the mid-to-low latitudes and mid-to-high latitudes after ~5600 B.P. [ 38 ] Human activity through land use changes already by the Mesolithic had major ecological impacts; [ 39 ] it was an important influence on Holocene climatic changes, and is believed to be why the Holocene is an atypical interglacial that has not experienced significant cooling over its course. [ 40 ] From the start of the Industrial Revolution onwards, large-scale anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions caused the Earth to warm. [ 41 ] Likewise, climatic changes have induced substantial changes in human civilisation over the course of the Holocene. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] During the transition from the last glacial to the Holocene, the Huelmo–Mascardi Cold Reversal in the Southern Hemisphere began before the Younger Dryas, and the maximum warmth flowed south to north from 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. It appears that this was influenced by the residual glacial ice remaining in the Northern Hemisphere until the later date. [ citation needed ] The first major phase of Holocene climate was the Preboreal . [ 44 ] At the start of the Preboreal occurred the Preboreal Oscillation (PBO). [ 45 ] The Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO) was a period of warming throughout the globe but was not globally synchronous and uniform. [ 46 ] Following the HCO, the global climate entered a broad trend of very gradual cooling known as Neoglaciation , which lasted from the end of the HCO to before the Industrial Revolution . [ 44 ] From the 10th-14th century, the climate was similar to that of modern times during a period known as the Mediaeval Warm Period (MWP), also known as the Mediaeval Climatic Optimum (MCO). It was found that the warming that is taking place in current years is both more frequent and more spatially homogeneous than what was experienced during the MWP. A warming of +1 degree Celsius occurs 5–40 times more frequently in modern years than during the MWP. The major forcing during the MWP was due to greater solar activity, which led to heterogeneity compared to the greenhouse gas forcing of modern years that leads to more homogeneous warming. This was followed by the Little Ice Age (LIA) from the 13th or 14th century to the mid-19th century. [ 47 ] The LIA was the coldest interval of time of the past two millennia. [ 48 ] Following the Industrial Revolution, warm decadal intervals became more common relative to before as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, resulting in progressive global warming. [ 41 ] In the late 20th century, anthropogenic forcing superseded variations in solar activity as the dominant driver of climate change, [ 49 ] though solar activity has continued to play a role. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Drangajökull , Iceland's northernmost glacier, melted shortly after 9,200 BP. [ 52 ] In Northern Germany , the Middle Holocene saw a drastic increase in the amount of raised bogs, most likely related to sea level rise. Although human activity affected geomorphology and landscape evolution in Northern Germany throughout the Holocene, it only became a dominant influence in the last four centuries. [ 53 ] In the French Alps , geochemistry and lithium isotope signatures in lake sediments have suggested gradual soil formation from the Last Glacial Period to the Holocene climatic optimum , and this soil development was altered by the settlement of human societies. Early anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and agriculture reinforced soil erosion, which peaked in the Middle Ages at an unprecedented level, marking human forcing as the most powerful factor affecting surface processes. [ 54 ] The sedimentary record from Aitoliko Lagoon indicates that wet winters locally predominated from 210 to 160 BP, followed by dry winter dominance from 160 to 20 BP. [ 55 ] North Africa, dominated by the Sahara Desert in the present, was instead a savanna dotted with large lakes during the Early and Middle Holocene, [ 56 ] regionally known as the African Humid Period (AHP). [ 57 ] The northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) produced increased monsoon rainfall over North Africa. [ 58 ] The lush vegetation of the Sahara brought an increase in pastoralism . [ 59 ] The AHP ended around 5,500 BP, after which the Sahara began to dry and become the desert it is today. [ 60 ] A stronger East African Monsoon during the Middle Holocene increased precipitation in East Africa and raised lake levels. [ 61 ] Around 800 AD, or 1,150 BP, a marine transgression occurred in southeastern Africa; in the Lake Lungué basin, this sea level highstand occurred from 740 to 910 AD, or from 1,210 to 1,040 BP, as evidenced by the lake's connection to the Indian Ocean at this time. This transgression was followed by a period of transition that lasted until 590 BP, when the region experienced significant aridification and began to be extensively used by humans for livestock herding. [ 62 ] In the Kalahari Desert , Holocene climate was overall very stable and environmental change was of low amplitude. Relatively cool conditions have prevailed since 4,000 BP. [ 63 ] In the Middle East , the Holocene brought a warmer and wetter climate, in contrast to the preceding cold, dry Younger Dryas . The Early Holocene saw the advent and spread of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent — sheep , goat , cattle , and later pig were domesticated, as well as cereals, like wheat and barley , and legumes —which would later disperse into much of the world. This ' Neolithic Revolution ', likely influenced by Holocene climatic changes, included an increase in sedentism and population, eventually resulting in the world's first large-scale state societies in Mesopotamia and Egypt . [ 64 ] During the Middle Holocene, the Intertropical Convergence Zone , which governs the incursion of monsoon precipitation through the Arabian Peninsula , shifted southwards, resulting in increased aridity. [ 65 ] In the Middle to Late Holocene, the coastline of the Levant and Persian Gulf receded, prompting a shift in human settlement patterns following this marine regression. [ 66 ] Central Asia experienced glacial-like temperatures until about 8,000 BP, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet collapsed. [ 67 ] In Xinjiang , long-term Holocene warming increased meltwater supply during summers, creating large lakes and oases at low altitudes and inducing enhanced moisture recycling. [ 68 ] In the Tien Shan , sedimentological evidence from Swan Lake suggests the period between 8,500 and 6,900 BP was relatively warm, with steppe meadow vegetation being predominant. An increase in Cyperaceae from 6,900 to 2,600 BP indicates cooling and humidification of the Tian Shan climate that was interrupted by a warm period between 5,500 and 4,500 BP. After 2,600 BP, an alpine steppe climate prevailed across the region. [ 69 ] Sand dune evolution in the Bayanbulak Basin shows that the region was very dry from the Holocene's beginning until around 6,500 BP, when a wet interval began. [ 70 ] In the Tibetan Plateau , the moisture optimum spanned from around 7,500 to 5,500 BP. [ 71 ] The Tarim Basin records the onset of significant aridification around 3,000-2,000 BP. [ 72 ] After 11,800 BP, and especially between 10,800 and 9,200 BP, Ladakh experienced tremendous moisture increase most likely related to the strengthening of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). From 9,200 to 6,900 BP, relative aridity persisted in Ladakh. A second major humid phase occurred in Ladakh from 6,900 to 4,800 BP, after which the region was again arid. [ 73 ] From 900 to 1,200 AD, during the MWP, the ISM was again strong as evidenced by low δ 18 O values from the Ganga Plain. [ 74 ] The sediments of Lonar Lake in Maharashtra record dry conditions around 11,400 BP that transitioned into a much wetter climate from 11,400 to 11,100 BP due to intensification of the ISM. Over the Early Holocene, the region was very wet, but during the Middle Holocene from 6,200 to 3,900 BP, aridification occurred, with the subsequent Late Holocene being relatively arid as a whole. [ 75 ] Coastal southwestern India experienced a stronger ISM from 9,690 to 7,560 BP, during the HCO. From 3,510 to 2,550 BP, during the Late Holocene, the ISM became weaker, although this weakening was interrupted by an interval of unusually high ISM strength from 3,400 to 3,200 BP. [ 76 ] Southwestern China experienced long-term warming during the Early Holocene up until ~7,000 BP. [ 77 ] Northern China experienced an abrupt aridification event approximately 4,000 BP. [ 78 ] From around 3,500 to 3,000 BP, northeastern China underwent a prolonged cooling, manifesting itself with the disruption of Bronze Age civilisations in the region. [ 79 ] Eastern and southern China, the monsoonal regions of China, were wetter than present in the Early and Middle Holocene. [ 80 ] Lake Huguangyan's TOC, δ 13 C wax , δ 13 C org , δ 15 N values suggest the period of peak moisture lasted from 9,200 to 1,800 BP and was attributable to a strong East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). [ 81 ] Late Holocene cooling events in the region were dominantly influenced by solar forcing, with many individual cold snaps linked to solar minima such as the Oort, Wolf , Spörer , and Maunder Minima . [ 82 ] A notable cooling event in southeastern China occurred 3,200 BP. [ 83 ] Strengthening of the winter monsoon occurred around 5,500, 4,000, and 2,500 BP. [ 84 ] Monsoonal regions of China became more arid in the Late Holocene. [ 80 ] In the Sea of Japan, the Middle Holocene was notable for its warmth, with rhythmic temperature fluctuations every 400–500 and 1,000 years. [ 85 ] Before 7,500 BP, the Gulf of Thailand was exposed above sea level and was very arid. A marine transgression occurred from 7,500 to 6,200 BP amidst global warming. [ 86 ] During the Middle Holocene, western North America was drier than present, with wetter winters and drier summers. [ 87 ] After the end of the thermal maximum of the HCO around 4,500 BP, the East Greenland Current underwent strengthening. [ 88 ] A massive megadrought occurred from 2,800 to 1,850 BP in the Great Basin . [ 89 ] Eastern North America underwent abrupt warming and humidification around 10,500 BP and then declined from 9,300 to 9,100 BP. The region has undergone a long term wettening since 5,500 BP occasionally interrupted by intervals of high aridity. A major cool event lasting from 5,500 to 4,700 BP was coeval with a major humidification before being terminated by a major drought and warming at the end of that interval. [ 90 ] During the Early Holocene, relative sea level rose in the Bahia region, causing a landward expansion of mangroves. During the Late Holocene, the mangroves declined as sea level dropped and freshwater supply increased. [ 91 ] In the Santa Catarina region, the maximum sea level highstand was around 2.1 metres above present and occurred about 5,800 to 5,000 BP. [ 92 ] Sea levels at Rocas Atoll were likewise higher than present for much of the Late Holocene. [ 93 ] The Northwest Australian Summer Monsoon was in a strong phase from 8,500 to 6,400 BP, from 5,000 to 4,000 BP (possibly until 3,000 BP), and from 1,300 to 900 BP, with weak phases in between and the current weak phase beginning around 900 BP after the end of the last strong phase. [ 94 ] Ice core measurements imply that the sea surface temperature (SST) gradient east of New Zealand, across the subtropical front (STF), was around 2 degrees Celsius during the HCO. This temperature gradient is significantly less than modern times, which is around 6 degrees Celsius. A study utilizing five SST proxies from 37°S to 60°S latitude confirmed that the strong temperature gradient was confined to the area immediately south of the STF, and is correlated with reduced westerly winds near New Zealand. [ 95 ] Since 7,100 BP, New Zealand experienced 53 cyclones similar in magnitude to Cyclone Bola . [ 96 ] Evidence from the Galápagos Islands shows that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was significantly weaker during the Middle Holocene, but that the strength of ENSO became moderate to high over the Late Holocene. [ 97 ] The decimation of terrestrial megafauna species outside of Africa during the preceding 40,000 years (the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions ), likely as a result of climate change, human hunting, or a combination of both, including in the extinction of over half of all megafauna species, left Holocene ecosystems highly altered and depauperate at their highest trophic levels compared to those in the preceding Pleistocene. [ 98 ] Megafauna losses continued during the early-mid Holocene, with the Irish elk ( Megaloceros giganteus , also known as the giant deer) surviving until around 7,700 years ago in western Russia, [ 99 ] with woolly mammoths ( Mammuthus primigenius ) surviving in mainland Siberia until around 10,000 years ago, [ 100 ] with a small population on Wrangel Island surviving until around 4,000 years ago. [ 101 ] Throughout the world, ecosystems in cooler climates that were previously regional have been isolated in higher altitude ecological ""islands"". [ 102 ] Surviving animal species like the red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) showed different behaviours: In the Adriatic region, they have been shown to migrate less than in the Pleistocene. [ 103 ] The 8.2-ka event , an abrupt cold spell recorded as a negative excursion in the δ 18 O record lasting 400 years, is the most prominent climatic event occurring in the Holocene Epoch, and may have marked a resurgence of ice cover. It has been suggested that this event was caused by the final drainage of Lake Agassiz , which had been confined by the glaciers, disrupting the thermohaline circulation of the Atlantic . [ 104 ] This disruption was the result of an ice dam over Hudson Bay collapsing sending cold lake Agassiz water into the North Atlantic ocean . [ 105 ] Furthermore, studies show that the melting of Lake Agassiz led to sea-level rise which flooded the North American coastal landscape. The basal peat plant was then used to determine the resulting local sea-level rise of 0.20-0.56m in the Mississippi Delta . [ 105 ] Subsequent research, however, suggested that the discharge was probably superimposed upon a longer episode of cooler climate lasting up to 600 years and observed that the extent of the area affected was unclear. [ 106 ] The beginning of the Holocene corresponds with the beginning of the Mesolithic age in most of Europe . In regions such as the Middle East and Anatolia , the term Epipaleolithic is preferred in place of Mesolithic, as they refer to approximately the same time period. Cultures in this period include Hamburgian , Federmesser , and the Natufian culture , during which the oldest inhabited places still existing on Earth were first settled, such as Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) in the Middle East . [ 107 ] There is also evolving archeological evidence of proto-religion at locations such as Göbekli Tepe , as long ago as the 9th millennium BC . [ 108 ] The preceding period of the Late Pleistocene had already brought advancements such as the bow and arrow , creating more efficient forms of hunting and replacing spear throwers . In the Holocene, however, the domestication of plants and animals allowed humans to develop villages and towns in centralized locations. Archaeological data shows that between 10,000 and 7,000 BP rapid domestication of plants and animals took place in tropical and subtropical parts of Asia , Africa , and Central America . [ 109 ] The development of farming allowed humans to transition away from hunter-gatherer nomadic cultures, which did not establish permanent settlements, to a more sustainable sedentary lifestyle . This form of lifestyle change allowed humans to develop towns and villages in centralized locations, which gave rise to the world known today. It is believed that the domestication of plants and animals began in the early part of the Holocene in the tropical areas of the planet. [ 109 ] Because these areas had warm, moist temperatures, the climate was perfect for effective farming. Culture development and human population change, specifically in South America, has also been linked to spikes in hydroclimate resulting in climate variability in the mid-Holocene (8.2–4.2 k cal BP). [ 110 ] Climate change on seasonality and available moisture also allowed for favorable agricultural conditions which promoted human development for Maya and Tiwanaku regions. [ 111 ] In the Korean Peninsula , climatic changes fostered a population boom during the Middle Chulmun period from 5,500 to 5,000 BP, but contributed to a subsequent bust during the Late and Final Chulmun periods, from 5,000 to 4,000 BP and from 4,000 to 3,500 BP respectively. [ 112 ] The Holocene extinction , otherwise referred to as the sixth mass extinction or Anthropocene extinction , [ 113 ] [ 114 ] is an ongoing extinction event of species during the present Holocene epoch (with the more recent time sometimes called Anthropocene) as a result of human activity . [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] The included extinctions span numerous families of fungi , [ 119 ] plants , [ 120 ] [ 121 ] and animals , including mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians , fish and invertebrates . With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests , as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background extinction rates . [ 116 ] [ 105 ] [ 122 ] [ 123 ]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology,"Etiology ( / ˌ iː t i ˈ ɒ l ə dʒ i / ; alternatively spelled aetiology or ætiology ) is the study of causation or origination. The word is derived from the Greek word αἰτιολογία ( aitiología ) , meaning ""giving a reason for"" (from αἰτία ( aitía ) ' cause ' and -λογία ( -logía ) ' study of ' ). [ 1 ] More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves. [ 2 ] The word is commonly used in medicine (pertaining to causes of disease or illness) and in philosophy , but also in physics , biology , psychology , political science , geography , cosmology , spatial analysis and theology in reference to the causes or origins of various phenomena . In the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, myths often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or origin myth , is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, Virgil 's Aeneid is a national myth written to explain and glorify the origins of the Roman Empire . In theology , many religions have creation myths explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers. In medicine, the etiology of an illness or condition refers to the frequent studies to determine one or more factors that come together to cause it. Relatedly, when disease is widespread, epidemiological studies investigate what associated factors, such as location, sex, exposure to chemicals, and many others, make a population more or less likely to have an illness, condition, or disease, thus helping determine its etiology. Sometimes determining etiology is an imprecise process. In the past, the etiology of a common sailor's disease, scurvy , was long unknown. When large, ocean-going ships were built, sailors began to put to sea for long periods of time, and often lacked fresh fruit and vegetables. Without knowing the precise cause, Captain James Cook suspected scurvy was caused by the lack of vegetables in the diet. Based on his suspicion, he forced his crew to eat sauerkraut , a cabbage preparation, every day, and based upon the positive outcomes, he inferred that it prevented scurvy, even though he did not know precisely why. It took about another two hundred years to discover the precise etiology: the lack of vitamin C in a sailor's diet. The following are examples of intrinsic factors: An etiological myth, or origin myth, is a myth intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like. For example, the name Delphi and its associated deity, Apollon Delphinios , are explained in the Homeric Hymn which tells of how Apollo, in the shape of a dolphin ( delphis ), propelled Cretans over the seas to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word delphus ('womb'), many etiological myths are similarly based on folk etymology (the term Amazon , for example). In the Aeneid (published c. 17 BC ), Virgil claims the descent of Augustus Caesar 's Julian clan from the hero Aeneas through his son Ascanius , also called Iulus. The story of Prometheus ' sacrifice trick at Mecone in Hesiod 's Theogony relates how Prometheus tricked Zeus into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. In Ovid 's Pyramus and Thisbe , the origin of the color of mulberries is explained, as the white berries become stained red from the blood gushing forth from their double suicide."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baluster,"A baluster ( / ˈ b æ l ə s t ər / ⓘ ) is an upright support, often a vertical moulded shaft, square, or lathe -turned form found in stairways , parapets , and other architectural features. In furniture construction it is known as a spindle . Common materials used in its construction are wood, stone, and less frequently metal and ceramic. A group of balusters supporting a guard railing , coping , or ornamental detail is known as a balustrade . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The term baluster shaft is used to describe forms such as a candlestick, upright furniture support, and the stem of a brass chandelier. [ citation needed ] The term banister (also bannister ) refers to a baluster or to the system of balusters and handrail of a stairway. [ 3 ] It may be used to include its supporting structures, such as a supporting newel post. [ 4 ] In the UK, there are different height requirements for domestic and commercial balustrades, as outlined in Approved Document K. [ 5 ] According to the Oxford English Dictionary , ""baluster"" is derived through the French : balustre , from Italian : balaustro , from balaustra , "" pomegranate flower"" [from a resemblance to the swelling form of the half-open flower ( illustration, below right )], [ 6 ] [ 7 ] from Latin balaustrium , from Greek βαλαύστριον ( balaustrion ). The earliest examples of balusters are those shown in the bas-reliefs representing the Assyrian palaces, where they were employed as functional window balustrades and apparently had Ionic capitals. [ 1 ] As an architectural element alone the balustrade did not seem to have been known to either the Greeks or the Romans , [ 1 ] [ 8 ] but baluster forms are familiar in the legs of chairs and tables represented in Roman bas-reliefs, [ 9 ] where the original legs or the models for cast bronze ones were shaped on the lathe, or in Antique marble candelabra, formed as a series of stacked bulbous and disc-shaped elements, both kinds of sources familiar to Quattrocento designers. The application to architecture was a feature of the early Renaissance architecture : late fifteenth-century examples are found in the balconies of palaces at Venice and Verona . These quattrocento balustrades are likely to be following yet-unidentified Gothic precedents . They form balustrades of colonettes [ 10 ] as an alternative to miniature arcading. Rudolf Wittkower withheld judgement as to the inventor of the baluster [ 11 ] and credited Giuliano da Sangallo with using it consistently as early as the balustrade on the terrace and stairs at the Medici villa at Poggio a Caiano ( c 1480), [ 12 ] and used balustrades in his reconstructions of antique structures. Sangallo passed the motif to Bramante (his Tempietto , 1502) and Michelangelo , through whom balustrades gained wide currency in the 16th century. Wittkower distinguished two types, one symmetrical in profile that inverted one bulbous vase-shape over another, separating them with a cushionlike torus or a concave ring, and the other a simple vase shape, whose employment by Michelangelo at the Campidoglio steps ( c 1546), noted by Wittkower, was preceded by very early vasiform balusters in a balustrade round the drum of Santa Maria delle Grazie ( c 1482), and railings in the cathedrals of Aquileia ( c 1495) and Parma , in the cortile of San Damaso, Vatican, and Antonio da Sangallo 's crowning balustrade on the Santa Casa at Loreto installed in 1535, and liberally in his model for the Basilica of Saint Peter . [ 13 ] Because of its low center of gravity , this ""vase-baluster"" may be given the modern term ""dropped baluster"". [ 14 ] Balusters may be made of carved stone , cast stone , plaster , polymer , polyurethane / polystyrene , polyvinyl chloride (PVC), precast concrete , wood , or wrought iron . Cast-stone balusters were a development of the 18th century in Great Britain (see Coade stone ), and cast iron balusters a development largely of the 1840s. [ citation needed ] As balusters and balustrades have evolved, they can now be made from various materials with a few popular choices being timber, glass and stainless steel. [ citation needed ] The baluster, being a turned structure , tends to follow design precedents that were set in woodworking and ceramic practices, where the turner's lathe and the potter's wheel are ancient tools. The profile a baluster takes is often diagnostic of a particular style of architecture or furniture, and may offer a rough guide to date of a design, though not of a particular example. Some complicated Mannerist baluster forms can be read as a vase set upon another vase. The high shoulders and bold, rhythmic shapes of the Baroque vase and baluster forms are distinctly different from the sober baluster forms of Neoclassicism , which look to other precedents, like Greek amphoras . The distinctive twist-turned designs of balusters in oak and walnut English and Dutch [ 16 ] seventeenth-century furniture, which took as their prototype the Solomonic column that was given prominence by Bernini , fell out of style after the 1710s. Once it had been taken from the lathe, a turned wood baluster could be split and applied to an architectural surface, or to one in which architectonic themes were more freely treated, as on cabinets made in Italy, Spain and Northern Europe from the sixteenth through the seventeenth centuries. [ 17 ] Modern baluster design is also in use for example in designs influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement in a 1905 row of houses in Etchingham Park Road Finchley London England. Outside Europe, the baluster column appeared as a new motif in Mughal architecture , introduced in Shah Jahan 's interventions in two of the three great fortress-palaces, the Red Fort of Agra and Delhi , [ 18 ] in the early seventeenth century. Foliate baluster columns with naturalistic foliate capitals, unexampled in previous Indo-Islamic architecture according to Ebba Koch , rapidly became one of the most widely used forms of supporting shaft in Northern and Central India in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. [ 19 ] The modern term baluster shaft is applied to the shaft dividing a window in Saxon architecture. In the south transept of the Abbey in St Albans , England, are some of these shafts, supposed to have been taken from the old Saxon church. Norman bases and capitals have been added, together with plain cylindrical Norman shafts. [ 1 ] Balusters are normally separated by at least the same measurement as the size of the square bottom section. Placing balusters too far apart diminishes their aesthetic appeal, and the structural integrity of the balustrade they form. Balustrades normally terminate in heavy newel posts, columns, and building walls for structural support. Balusters may be formed in several ways. Wood and stone can be shaped on the lathe, wood can be cut from square or rectangular section boards, while concrete, plaster, iron, and plastics are usually formed by molding and casting. Turned patterns or old examples are used for the molds."
