Previously, she's held beauty roles at Harper's Bazaar, Marie Claire, SELF, and Cosmopolitan; her byline has appeared in Esquire, Sports Illustrated, and Allure.com.

We love celebrating women on top of their game. In our new series Game On, we're interviewing top athletes about their well-being routines—covering everything from nutrition that makes them feel strong to the moments that bring them joy. If you've come across 27-year-old Team USA Rugby star Ilona Maher 's TikTok videos , you know how charming she can be. Considering her page has over 1.1 million followers and 87.7 million likes, there's a good chance you've come across a video or two if you're on the platform. In fact, when I shared that I'd recently interviewed Maher to a friend, she gushed: I love her TikToks . ""If you want to make a career out of rugby or if you want to make enough money as a professional athlete in rugby, you have to have a social media presence. I treat it as a second job, if not right up there with my first job of being an athlete. Because at the spot we are as a sport and a women's sport, I'm not going to get too much of a livable income with just rugby,"" she told me about why she's made social media a priority. The rugby center's exploding popularity may be thanks to her social media prowess, but make no mistake: Her strength will take center stage during this year's Olympic Games in Paris . As she gears up for her second Olympics, I was able to chat with her about how she stays strong, what fuels her, and why she wears lipstick on the field. mindbodygreen: What meals make you feel strongest? Ilona Maher: I don't feel bad about eating. I've been training my mind and training myself to [get to that mindset]. Even being a professional athlete—but I think all women experience this—we deal with eating and our bodies. For me, it's been really freeing to learn what foods it takes to be at my top performance. The meals feel good when I know I need this food to fuel myself. I'm more about function versus form. Because right now I'm supposed to be big. I'm supposed to be powerful. And I'm using these meals to do it. But my favorite meals have to be the ones that my mom makes. It's homey. It's what I grew up on. It's what kind of made me into the athlete I am today. She can cook a steak like no one else, and she makes this chicken satay that's amazing. She marinates the chicken, grills it, and then makes this peanut butter sauce that you dip it in by the spoonful. I would say that's my favorite. mbg: How do you mentally prepare for a game? Maher: It's interesting because I try not to let rugby control my mind the whole time. When people are like, ""Oh, how do you do social media with the rugby?"" But it's actually about finding that balance because if I was thinking about rugby all the time, it would be a lot. I think sometimes it can be a nice escape. But to get into the game, before it starts, I do have to amp myself up. It's such a hard sport. I feel so tired constantly. I'm getting beat up out there. And we play in these hot places. I say to myself before I'm about to run out, ""If it were easy, everybody would do it. This is a very hard sport, and I'm so honored that I can do it."" It kind of puts it into perspective when I'm tired. It's also about connecting with my teammates and getting to do this with my best buddies. mbg: What's the most intense thing you've ever tried to optimize your performance? Maher: I don't know if this is really intense, but heat training. We play in such hot environments sometimes—like Singapore; Hong Kong; Perth, Australia, during heat waves, and as high as 114 degrees—so we get into heat acclimation. Preparing yourself to be able to perform in that environment starts back home. So even now I do heat acclimation just to prepare myself for summer in Paris. For example, we'll sit in the sauna after we did a bike session in a heated room with sweatshirts and sweatpants on. Or we get into a hot tub with our sweatpants on. mbg: How do you rebound after a tough game? Maher: That's been something I've definitely been learning, like constantly. It never gets easier, but you learn how to deal with it better in a way. In the last Olympics, we lost, and that was very hard, but I've been learning how to play it to my advantage. After we lose, one thing I focus on is connecting with my teammates. Because a lot of times people put things on themselves like, ""Oh, I knocked that ball on,"" or ""I missed that tackle that led to [the loss]."" It's important to remember that no one moment loses a game for us. We have so many moments throughout a game, and it's never that one moment. Like, yeah, maybe someone missed that tackle, but what about earlier in the game when I missed it? You're not out there alone, and you're not losing on your own. You're losing with this other group of women who are going through the same stuff. So it's really important to be with them and connect with them, laugh about it, talk about the parts that went well, the parts that went bad, what to take from it. mbg: I wanted to ask you about teammates anyway. One of the things that playing sports teaches us is how to be a good teammate and how to show up for other people. So what makes a good teammate? How do you show up for your teammates? Maher: I think what's fun about being on a team is having those different personalities around you. You need the person who is going to go quiet and wants to get in their head before a game. Or myself before a game, I'm loud, I want to dance, and I want to connect with people. So it's important to recognize there are so many different teammates and personalities that make up a team—and that's what makes a team special. You don't want all the same athletes out there. Being a good teammate is also about helping others rise up as well. For example, what I've been trying to do on social media has been for myself, but it's also been for my teammates. I try to bring them into any video I can or encourage them to post. My teammate once told me ""a rising tide lifts all boats,"" which is a great way to think about it. It's about lifting up others, lifting my teammates, and making them feel good. mbg: The social media side of it is interesting because we're definitely in this moment in which women athletes are receiving more—and much deserved—attention. And for many athletes, social media can be a tool to ensure longevity in their career or after their career. You mentioned earlier that it's about finding a balance between the two—how do you find that balance? Maher: I've almost had to find a balance. If you want to make a career out of rugby or if you want to make enough money as a professional athlete in rugby, you have to have a social media presence. I treat it as a second job, if not right up there with my first job of being an athlete. Because at the spot we are as a sport and a women's sport, I'm not going to get too much of a livable income with just rugby. I do get paid for rugby, and it's amazing that I have that possibility for me in the U.S. But all of us want to make more money, and all of us want to get sponsored. And after the [Tokyo] Olympics, I realized, Oh this is how I can do that. I have to use this tool to my advantage. My teammates and I talk about this all the time, ""I want to make more money,"" or ""I want to get sponsors,"" and the thing is: You have to post. It's a very vulnerable state, but you have to put yourself out there. It's scary sometimes, but I view it as This is how I make this career sustainable. For a lot of athletes after they retire, they just go back to regular jobs—like this was all a fever dream of traveling the world to play rugby. But I want to make this my career long term. Image by mbg Creative / courtesy of source mbg: This touches on a topic I wanted to discuss anyway: What are the double-standards that exist for women versus men in rugby that you want to address? Maher: Well, I think the first thing is that rugby is only a men's sport—that it is so physical, it's not meant for women and you have to be a man to play it. And to play rugby as a woman, there's this idea that you have to almost reject your femininity and go out there and be a masculine version of yourself. And for a lot of sports, that stops girls from playing. Because they'll think, I don't want people to think of me this way or I don't want to risk my femininity or how beautiful I feel. Those misconceptions stop people from playing sports. They stop people from really understanding what their body's capable of. Sports give your body a purpose that's not just to be looked at and objectified. I think sports give you an appreciation for your body. I think for me, being that rugby athlete in the limelight, I want to show that I can be this very big, powerful person, but I can also wear lipstick on the field to show that you can bring your femininity on the field too. I know that in our seventh circuit now, we have a lot of girls who put on a full face of makeup and who want to go out there and be pretty. I love that because I don't think you have to sacrifice that to play this traditionally very ""manly"" sport. I think what's cool about our game is that people are like, ""Oh, well maybe it's not like the men's in every way, It's different in some ways and different doesn't mean bad. They're still both very exciting games to watch."" mbg: That's a really important message because when you look at the research, the reason young girls drop out of sports at a higher rate than boys is usually because of confidence issues. So to show that you can be confident in both sides of yourself is really valuable. Speaking of embracing different sides of yourself: I know you love beauty products. What products do you love using right now? Maher: I've been using Medalist , which is a new brand that's by athletes for athletes. We've been testing out the products—like No Fric Stick Anti Chafe + Cooling Balm —which I use on and off the field. It's been really helpful for my pregame, pre-practice, and after-practice routine. What I really love is that we're working with athletes of all abilities, all sports, and all disciplines. Athletes come in truly all shapes and sizes and need their skin care routines! mbg: Being a professional athlete has a unique challenge of it being this thing you obviously love doing but is—at the end of the day—a high-pressure job. In what moments do you find that childlike joy again? Maher: It's funny, before practices, we'll play fun games. It's literally grown women—you know, some in our late 20s or 30s—playing tag with each other. We're laughing and giggling. I made a joke that my friend just got married and bought a house, but I'm here playing tag with my friends in the sun. But that brings me back to like why I love it. I love the community of sports, how it brings you in, and how it makes you feel about yourself. I think that those are the moments where I really get back to why I love rugby and love the people I get to do it with."

Whenever we bring a fresh bouquet home, the hope is that it'll stay vivacious and vibrant for as many days as possible. Thankfully, there are a few ways to play with the water in a cut flower vase to help blooms last longer, and adjusting surrounding air quality can also help stave off decay to a degree. When it comes to clearing the air so your flowers can stay fresh, ethylene is the name to know. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that flowers and fruits accumulate and emit as they age. Caren Chang, Ph.D., a professor at the University of Maryland who researches the gas, says that, on the plus side, it helps promote fruit ripening. (It's why you can stick a green tomato into a paper bag with a nearly gone banana. The banana will emit ethylene gas that helps the tomato ripen.) The downside, Chang explains, is that ethylene can also cause leaves to drop and flower petals to die off. Injured flowers—like those that have just been collected for a bouquet —will give off a lot of ethylene as a last resort, hence why cut flowers tend to lose their vigor relatively quickly. As such, to keep them in good shape for longer, you'll want to minimize their exposure to any excess ethylene gas. Here are two easy ways to do so: Place them away from fruit bowls Some plant species emit more ethylene than others. ""Tomatoes, apples, bananas, pears, and many other fruits emit a high level of ethylene because, in most plants, the ethylene hormone is an essential hormone for fruit ripening,"" Chang tells mindbodygreen. Once in the air, the ethylene that these fruits emit can travel a long way. In the process, it tends to disperse and lose some of its potency. Chang notes that by the time it reaches any nearby flowers, the ethylene from fruits will likely have diffused enough to not be an issue. However, floral stylist Harriet Parry previously told mbg that she's noticed flowers do tend to fade faster when placed next to fruits. To play it safe, you may want to keep your cut flowers away from your open fruit bowls to prevent premature decay. Place them away from grills or fire pits Natural gas and petroleum are also major sources of ethylene (a natural byproduct of combustion), meaning they can be harmful to plant life. For evidence of this, Chang points to one study conducted on the busy Beltway highway 1 in Washington, D.C., that found that the high ethylene levels from car exhaust caused nearby plants to grow stunted. ""When the ethylene was chemically removed from the Beltway environment, the plants looked much better,"" she says. And back in the 1800s, when street lamps were lit with gas, the trees surrounding the street lamps tended to drop their leaves. For this reason, Chang recommends placing all your plants—cut or not—away from any gas source (car exhaust, fire pits, barbecue grills, oil lanterns, etc.) to keep them growing vigorously. The takeaway There are many ways to get a few more colorful days out of your cut flowers. Besides the basic care tips like cutting their stems at an angle, cleaning out their water, and keeping them away from direct sun, placing them out of ethylene hot spots may help them bloom brighter and longer. 1 Source https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00022470.1973.10469798"

But don't waffle over your purchase too long; the sale ends on Monday taking these unbeatable prices with it. Solawave 4-in-1 Skincare Wand $169 Why I can't stop talking about the Solawave My Solawave love story first began when my friend and I decided to test the wand leading up to her wedding. Because what better time to see if this sleek device could actually reduce the appearance of wrinkles , fine lines, dark circles, and blemishes? At the time, I couldn't scroll through social media without being served a testimonial for Solawave's 4-in-1 Red Light Wand , but the skeptic in me questioned these reviewers' potentially filtered glow. Turns out, the wand was worth the hype. After seeing results from day one (read: less puffiness and a smoother, more sculpted face), I quickly integrated the device into my routine, where it's remained ever since. I find it incredibly difficult to stick to skin care routines, but the visible results kept me coming back to the Solawave .

It's where I've seen the most significant change in smoothness since incorporating the Solawave into my beauty routine—and the brand just launched a red light mask designed specifically to renew the skin on your neck and chest .

When I did see my facialist a few months after purchasing the Solawave , she even commented on my skin's improvements and questioned what I was doing differently. Solawave 4-in-1 Skincare Wand $169 The takeaway Despite my initial skepticism, the Solawave has proven itself tenfold . My previously mentioned friend and I still use our devices regularly, raving to each other about our smoother, glowier skin . My only regret is not buying this deal when I had the chance—but I'll be taking advantage of it this holiday season to give the ultimate gift."
https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/are-your-mushroom-supplements-helping-your-immune-system,"Are Your Mushroom Supplements Helping Your Immune System? | mindbodygreen Skip to Content Accessibility Statement paid content for Are Your Mushroom Supplements Helping Your Immune System? Author: Devon Barrow June 20, 2024 Branded Content Editor By Devon Barrow Image by Andrew Thomas / Stocksy June 20, 2024 So you've been wondering about taking functional mushrooms to support your immune system. It's a wise idea: Mushrooms are now well-established for their inflammatory-balancing and antioxidant properties.* Plus, they're full of proteins, antioxidants, and fatty acids—all of which play a role in immunity. These days, the question is less about whether you're taking mushrooms and more about where you're getting them. For the sake of your immune system, you deserve the best. The truth about your mushroom supplement If you're wondering what all the mushroom hype is about, it starts with beta-glucans 1 . These beneficial polysaccharides make up the cell walls of mushrooms and are connected 1 to heart health, gut health, immune function, inflammatory response, and beyond.* Research indicates that beta-glucans (and other beneficial components) are found most abundantly in the mushroom's fruiting body—that is, everything aboveground. However, most mushroom supplements on the market today are made out of the mycelium , or the root of the mushroom. While mycelium certainly has its own benefits, supplements made from the fruiting body guarantee you're getting the good stuff. As far as quality goes, Gaia Herbs' pure extraction process sets the gold standard. It starts with harvesting the fruiting bodies at their peak. From there, they dry and powder the mushrooms before concentrating them in hot water for five hours. Before capsulation, this concentrated extract undergoes the same quality testing as the rest of their herbs to ensure potency, purity, and integrity. With Gaia Herbs, you get 100% mushrooms—which is harder to find than you'd think. Image by Gaia Herbs / Contributor The case for fruiting bodies Here's the issue with mushroom supplements made from mycelium. Mushrooms are often grown using grain substrates like rice or oats. This substrate allows the mycelium (or the roots) to grow, but it's difficult to extract. Because of that, the growth substrate often ends up in the final product—which means you're taking mushrooms but also added ingredients like fillers, grain, and starch. Not only does Gaia Herbs harvest their supplements from the fruiting body, but they also get as close to a natural environment as possible. Their chaga , for example, is grown on Siberian birch located on organically managed land. Their reishi is cultivated on beachwood log. This paints a picture of the brand's commitment to sustainable sourcing. It's also how you end up with a 100% mushroom supplement. How to choose the right mushroom for your immunity But returning to why a quality mushroom supplement really matters… Your immune system gets more bang for your buck! And by that we mean—more beta-glucans. For years, vitamin C and zinc have been ruling our immunity routines. But now that we know what mushrooms are capable of, that's all changing. All mushrooms are packed with health benefits. But certain fungi are more connected to immune support than others.* Need a little extra respiratory support?* Or a helping hand for your liver?* Not to worry, there's a mushroom for that: Reishi Reishi mushroom, also known as the ""mushroom of immortality,"" has been shown to support overall immune function as well as cardiovascular health.* If you're looking to boost your overall longevity, Gaia Herbs Reishi Mushroom is your go-to.* Turkey Tail Researchers 2 actually consider our liver an ""innate immunity organ"" due to its high concentration of immune cells. Gaia Herbs Turkey Tail promotes healthy liver function and support.* As the most widely studied mushroom, give this fun-guy a front-row spot in your supplement cabinet. Chaga Chaga is known for offering antioxidant support 3 and has long been used to prompt healthy cell turnover and gut health (another key aspect of immunity).* Gaia Herbs' Everyday Immune is formulated with chaga, reishi, and maitake—another mushroom known for immune support.* Combined with immune-supporting herbs, this everyday supplement checks all boxes.* The bottom line Immunity can be one of those things you take for granted until you're feeling a little under the weather. We're big believers that immunity isn't just something you focus on during winter or when you feel a bug coming on. Immunity is a lifestyle —and choosing a high-quality supplement, like Gaia Herbs , is how we can ensure we're giving our immune system its best chance!* Remember: Your health deserves nothing less than transparent sourcing, high quality, and integrity. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Daily protein intake Timing for weight loss Pre vs. post-exercise Morning vs. evening Types of protein powder Recipes FAQ March 17, 2023 Protein is an essential macronutrient that fuels a lot more than just #gains. Composing about 15% of our 1 body weight, protein helps build teeny tiny cells, large joints and organs, and everything in between. It plays a role in your energy levels, immune function, and metabolic health, too. Your body is always breaking down protein, so it needs a consistent supply from your diet. But is there a certain time of the day that's considered best for refueling? Let's explore the best times to consume protein powder so it works the hardest for you. Why you should spread out your protein intake. Before you think about timing your protein to a tee, you'll need to make sure you're getting enough of the macronutrient in the first place. Most active people will want to consume around 1.4 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight 2 . If you weigh 165 pounds, that's around 105 to 150 grams of protein per day. By hitting this threshold, you're ensuring that your body has enough protein to build muscle , support metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and more. ""The most important part, it seems based on the research, is total protein intake in a day,"" says Shawn Arent, Ph.D. , a professor of exercise science at the University of South Carolina. ""You can time the crap out of your protein, but if you're not eating enough per day, it's a drop in the bucket."" Ideally, you'll be able to meet your protein needs by eating whole-food protein sources . However, protein powders can be a convenient way to fill gaps in the diet and get a meaningful amount of protein without needing to fire up your stove. Rather than trying to cram 100+ grams of protein into one meal (that's a lot of eggs and whey), you'll want to spread your protein intake throughout the day— starting with breakfast . The first meal of the day is important because when you're sleeping, your body is in a catabolic state in which muscle tissue is broken down for its constituent amino acids. And you'll stay in this state until you replenish your body with the amino acids it needs to enter an anabolic state and rebuild muscle again—a process called muscle protein synthesis (MPS). ""The first meal after you're coming out of an overnight fast is absolutely critical,"" Don Layman, Ph.D., a leading protein and amino acid researcher and professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , previously told mindbodygreen . ""Until you have a meal that triggers MPS, you'll stay catabolic."" And what sets off MPS and gets us into an anabolic state? You guessed it: protein. Layman's research has found that consuming an adequate serving of protein (at least 20 to 30 grams) starting at your first meal of the day 3 will support muscle protein synthesis more effectively than eating the majority of your protein at dinner. It will also set you up to fulfill that all-important daily protein quota. As long as you're consuming enough protein a day 4 , and spreading it across a few meals and snacks , the exact hours of your protein intake don't matter as much. However, there are some ways to optimize your timing slightly depending on your specific goals. Summary Before you think about protein timing, you'll want to make sure you're eating enough protein per day—upward of 100 grams for most people—and splitting it up across a few meals (starting at breakfast). Aim for roughly 30 grams of protein per meal. Protein to lose weight. If you're looking to lose weight (while maintaining muscle mass), consuming protein powder in the morning can be beneficial. Not only will it kick-start MPS, but protein is also highly satiating, meaning it can help you start your day feeling full and satisfied. It also has what's known as an insulinotropic effect 5 , so it helps clear glucose from your blood and can assist with stabilizing blood sugar. ""Less insulin spiking means more sustained energy levels and fewer hunger pangs throughout the day,"" Gabrielle Lyon, D.O., a functional medicine physician and the founder of the Institute for Muscle-Centric Medicine , previously told mindbodygreen . In research on adolescents with obesity 6 , eating a high-protein breakfast (35 grams) helped prevent fat gain and reduce daily hunger more than eating a lower-protein breakfast or skipping breakfast altogether. If fat loss is your goal, you'll want to get plenty of exercise—particularly strength training —daily too. Pairing a protein-rich diet with intermittent fasting has also been shown to promote fat loss and improved metabolic health in recent research 7 , likely due to the way that restricting your eating window can reduce calorie intake. (Just note that this strategy is not effective for everybody and may be unsafe for pregnant and breastfeeding women or anyone with a history of an eating disorder. Talk to your doctor before trying it.) Here is a complete guide to using protein powder for weight loss . Summary If you're looking to lose fat while building or maintaining muscle, consuming protein in the morning (and pairing it with exercise) can help keep you more full and satisfied throughout the day. Should I consume protein before or after exercise? There's a reason the stereotypical weightlifter follows up every gym session with a protein shake. Eating protein after a workout helps refuel the body and restore muscle tissue that was damaged during exercise. The ""anabolic window of opportunity"" is the amount of time post-workout that your body is primed to synthesize new proteins. Researchers used to think this time window was relatively short—around 30 to 60 minutes—but this notion has since been challenged 8 . ""The reality is that the window is more like a garage door—it's much bigger than we thought it was,"" Arent explains. ""If you don't eat protein right after a workout, it's not like you're going to lose all the hard work you just put in."" So if you forgot to bring your shake to the gym, it's fine to wait until you're home and showered to refuel with protein as well as some carbs . Whether you eat protein one hour after a workout or three, research shows the effects on MPS will be similar 9 . One exception is if you work out first thing in the morning without eating beforehand. In that case, you'll want to refuel quickly 10 because you may still be in a more catabolic state. As for the benefits of eating protein before a workout , the research is more mixed and it seems to depend on the person. There are some early studies suggesting that pre-workout protein might be more important for women 11 , but we don't know for sure. Summary Eating post-workout seems to be more important for recovery and MPS, but if you prefer to sip a protein shake before the gym and it doesn't upset your stomach, there's certainly no harm in doing so. Should I consume protein in the morning or at night? As we've already covered, eating protein in the morning or during your first meal is key for getting your day off on the right foot. However, emerging research is also finding that consuming a concentrated dose of protein right before bed can be helpful for heavy exercisers. One 2019 study published in Frontiers of Nutrition 12 found that for those who were doing a prolonged period of resistance training, consuming 40 grams of protein before bed stimulated MPS during the overnight recovery period—a time when muscle would usually be breaking down. This can also be a smart strategy for athletes with very high protein needs who would benefit from having one more protein-heavy meal each day. There is also some evidence, though it's inconclusive 13 , that consuming protein right before bed can help older people combat age-related muscle loss , which is a concern after the age of 65 or so. If you opt to consume protein shortly before bed, be sure to choose a protein powder that's easy to digest and won't disrupt your sleep . Slow-digesting casein protein is a popular choice. RELATED READ: The Best Time To Take 15 Vitamins & Supplements: A Scannable Guide Summary If you're going to choose one or the other, drinking protein powder in the morning will be more beneficial for most people. However, athletes and those with very high protein needs may also get added benefits from protein right before bed. Types of protein powder. As Arent puts it, you can look at your protein routine like a birthday cake: Your total protein intake is the cake itself, and it sets the foundation. Protein timing is like the icing. And in this scenario, the protein type is the candle on top. To maximize your recovery and growth, you'll want to opt for a protein source that contains all the essential amino acids in the correct amounts. You should pay particular attention to leucine, which is known as an anabolic trigger because of its ability to switch on MPS, but they're all important. ""Leucine starts the igniter, but you still have to have sufficient amounts of the other amino acids to keep protein synthesis going,"" says Matthew E. Stark, M.S., RDN, LDN , the program coordinator of Nutrition and Dietetics at Northern Illinois University. ""If you're low on one, that could stunt the protein synthesis, even though you did have sufficient leucine."" Animal proteins tend to be higher in leucine than plant proteins , but a well-formulated plant protein powder can hit the leucine threshold needed to spur MPS ( around 2.5 grams per serving 14 ). There are many types of protein powders available, each with its own pros and cons, and you can learn all about the most popular here . When shopping for the right protein powder for you, be it whey isolate or pea protein , be sure to look for one that has at least 25 to 30 grams of protein per serving 15 , has a healthy amino acid composition, is sustainably sourced, comes from a reputable company, and is low on additives and extra sugars. mbg's picks for clean protein powders Mt Capra Clean Whey Protein $46 Antler Farms New Zealand Whey Protein Isolate $60 Truvani Organic Vanilla Plant Based Protein Powder $50 Creative ways to consume protein powder. We've established that protein is essential throughout the day, from morning until night. If you're looking to use protein powder to up your daily protein intake , here are some creative ways to do so—beyond just another smoothie or shake. Breakfast: Add it to your overnight oats or hot oatmeal Add flavored protein to coffee Add it to the batter of your waffles or pancakes Snack: Add it to your brownie or cookie batter Whip up a collagen pudding Use it to make energy balls Dinner: Swirl unflavored protein into mashed potatoes or yogurt Mix it into salad dressing FAQ Is it better to drink a protein shake before or after workout? Drinking a protein shake after a workout will go a longer way in supporting recovery and muscle protein synthesis. But you don't need to rush to drink it right away. The anabolic window is longer than previously thought, so just aim to consume protein within a few hours of exercise. Should I take protein powder every day? You should be consuming enough protein every day—but it doesn't need to be in powder form. But if you struggle to meet your daily protein requirements with food alone, consuming protein powder every day is a safe way to supplement. Should I drink protein shakes on non-workout days? Your body always needs protein, even on rest days! And if a protein shake helps you fulfill your daily quota, you should still drink it even on days you don't work out. It's a myth that eating protein without working out makes you gain weight; learn why here . The takeaway. As long as you're getting enough protein each day, the timing of your protein doesn't matter as much. However, there are a few times throughout the day—like in the morning and after a workout—when drinking a protein shake may be even more beneficial for muscle growth and recovery . 15 Sources https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/78/5/979/4677508 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28642676/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018950/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24299050/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30008106/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26239831/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36575144/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5596471/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10658002/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3577439/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30366741/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6415027/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32811763/ https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/136/1/319S/4664148 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872778/"

She graduated from Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Science degree in magazine journalism and a minor in nutrition. Image by Pixel Stories / Stocksy December 27, 2025 Depression and anxiety are as conventional as the common cold these days. Whether you've struggled with clinical depression or anxiety for years or have experienced bouts of one (or both) alongside stress or chronic illness, these neuropsychiatric disorders are all but unavoidable. Thanks to research on the gut-brain axis , scientists have found that our diet and overall gut health play a significant role in mental well-being—and an Antioxidants narrative review breaks down exactly which foods, drinks, and nutrients have been found to prevent and manage depression and anxiety symptoms. How diet can help prevent & manage depression & anxiety Whether you've personally dealt with these neuropsychiatric disorders or have witnessed a family member, friend, or peer fight their own mental health battles, everyone is affected by depression and anxiety in some shape or form. Whole foods and nutrients like fish, coffee, tea, berries, omega-3 fatty acids , antioxidants (e.g., lycopene, resveratrol, selenium), and even dietary fiber have been found to play a critical role in the prevention and management of depression and anxiety. These nutrients and foods help promote mental well-being by: Inhibiting inflammation Fighting free radicals to reduce oxidative stress Modulating gut microbiota Preventing hyperactivity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis—i.e., the neuroendocrine mechanism that controls the body's reaction to stress Supporting healthy levels of monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine), which play a key role in mood regulation omega-3 potency+ Delivers the right amount of crucial fatty acids so your body can function at its best.* ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (58) Foods, drinks, and nutrients for depression Pathologically, depression is often associated with inflammation in the brain, monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency, gut microbiota disorder, and HPA axis hyperactivity . Consumption of the following foods, drinks, and dietary nutrients have been found to lower the risk of depression and depressive symptoms in clinical trials: Fish Fatty fish Fatty fish Mushroom fiber Walnuts Green tea Tea Coffee Dietary fiber Selenium In animal studies, many common nutrients and supplement ingredients —including fish oil and omega-3s, navel orange and garlic essential oils, antioxidants (e.g., curcumin , lycopene , resveratrol , maqui berry, and EGCG), and various probiotic strains—have also been found to protect against and treat depressive mechanisms. Foods, drinks, and nutrients for anxiety According to the narrative review, anxiety is initiated and developed by oxidative stress, inflammation, and serotonergic and noradrenergic dysfunction (i.e., imbalances in serotonin and noradrenaline, aka norepinephrine)—but certain foods and nutrients can help. Consumption of the following foods, drinks, and dietary nutrients have been found to lower the risk of and protect against anxiety in clinical trials: Legumes and nuts Dietary fiber Omega-3 fatty acids BCAAs Vitamin B6 In animal studies, a variety of foods, nutrients, and common supplement ingredients—such as honey, goat milk fat, breadfruit pulp, red pomegranate fruit extract, bergamot essential oil, omega-3s, phytonutrients (e.g., saffron, curcumin, and L-theanine ), and various probiotic strains have also been found to reduce the prevalence and treat the effects of anxiety. The takeaway There are a number of neuroprotective foods, drinks, and nutrients you can add to your diet to help prevent and/or manage depression and anxiety. For an even easier solution, consider adding a quality supplement with one (or many!) of the ingredients listed above to your daily routine. omega-3 potency+ Delivers the right amount of crucial fatty acids so your body can function at its best.* ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (58) ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ( 58 )"

My son even said “Katie Austin” before he knew the names of his relatives! Whether I’m at the gym or pressed for time at home, I always have the perfect workout option— and recipes! Let’s not forget the recipes! Hopkinton, MA Age 36 San Francisco, CA Age 22 Plus, working out with Katie feels like exercising with a friend who’s there to cheer you on. It’s motivating and makes the whole process way more enjoyable. Overall, the app fits perfectly into my hectic life, helping me stay fit and healthy without the stress!! I discovered Katie Austin workouts via YouTube when I was too afraid to face my fear and workout at the gym. Katie’s workout videos had me hooked and so excited to better my health! I have been to just about every gym or fitness studio, tried countless different virtual programs and nothing has stuck like the Katie Austin app. While I tend to get bored very easily and like to change it up, I love how I can either do a Katie Austin app quickie at home, outside, or challenge myself to do a quick core or ab workout in the sauna for an extra burn! The recipes are also amazing, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say that her workouts are my absolute favorite part about the app! Growing up overweight, diagnosed pre-diabetic at 17, and down almost 60 pounds to date- I always thought that you had to workout for hours a day and stay in a calorie deficit, but I’ve learned all you need is 20-30 minutes of movement a day and her videos are the *sweet spot* of activity you should do daily! San Antonio, TX Age 25 As a busy work from home sports mom, the KA Daily App is my absolute favorite way to workout. Her energy and realness is my favorite part of every workout. This program helped me lose over 30 lbs after having my third child, and it’s kept me in shape so I’m able to keep up with all of the activities being a sports mom entails. I tell everyone about this app because I love it so much and it’s made such a positive impact in my life. Tuscon, AZ Age 34 I’m so happy I am apart of this amazing group and would love to share it with everyone! I was doing other apps and classes at studios but nothing had me hooked like Katie’s app. I love that the classes are under an hour so I can get my workout in but still sweat a ton!!! I love her personality and how she makes fitness so much fun. She’s super inspiring and I can really relate to her content. Brea, CA Age 34 Severn, MD Age 41 I have followed Katie for years and am so glad I tried the app. She always brings such a fun energy to her workouts and does a great job of explaining each move/what muscle groups are being targeted. I grew up with my mom working out to Denise Austin so it’s nice that now I get to workout with Katie. I love the Katie Austin app! I am currently working through the 28-day bridal glow series and I love that every single workout is broken down by day. She has all of them grouped together and when I get home from work I just throw on the app on my TV and do my workout for whatever is planned for that day. Dallas, TX New York City, NY Age 41 I’ve had the blessing to meet Katie since I’m an SI hopeful on her first year as a rookie and I’ve worked out with her in person. She’s fun and I love her energy in person so becoming part of the app while I was recovering home due that I had to relearned how to walk again and do the little things like tie my shoe lace or lay on my back I found this app so motivational and fun to do home. Age 26 As someone fortunate enough to workout with her in person at the KAA event in Nashville, to working out with her on my screen, Katie has the ability to make you feel seen whether she can actually see you or not. It feels like a one on one workout. She makes working out fun and light, but the impact is anything but simple. I’m always sore (in the best way) after a workout. Don’t let home workouts fool you - they mean business! Whether I am walking it out, working out, or whipping up Katie’s recipes in the kitchen, the Katie Austin app has me covered! Nashville, TN Age 42 As a former D1 athlete like Katie, I appreciate how she explains every move and why it works.
